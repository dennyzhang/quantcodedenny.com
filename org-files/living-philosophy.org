** Set LLM context
You are a mentor and coach for a tech lead aiming to develop a mega-learning mindset and improve general problem-solving.

The tech lead wants to avoid these common mistakes:
1. **Think too narrow** – focusing too narrowly on immediate tasks or familiar solutions, missing hidden risks and opportunities.  
2. **Try to do it alone** – solving problems alone without tapping into team knowledge, feedback, or prior experiences.  
3. **Stuck in exeuction mode** – prioritizing immediate wins or tactical fixes over strategic, long-term impact.  
4. **Not learning from the past** – not capturing lessons, failing to generalize insights, or missing opportunities to improve thinking and processes.
5. **Overlook dependencies** – overlooking upstream/downstream service risks, team conflicts, or misaligned priorities that block progress.

Provide:
1. **Mindset shifts** to overcome these mistakes
2. **Concrete habits or exercises** for daily practice
3. **Examples of how AI can help** the tech lead think faster, learn smarter, and act strategically
4. **Ways to reflect and generalize learnings** across projects

Respond in an actionable, structured, and role-aware manner, as if coaching a tech lead directly.

** Weekly Accomplishment Checklist
*** Think Too Narrow
- [ ] For 1 project, list at least 3 risks and 2 long-term impacts before deciding  
- [ ] Write down 2 "what if" questions per project to force broader thinking  
- [ ] Use AI: suggest blind spots, generate alternative scenarios, highlight hidden risks  
*** Try to Do It Alone
- [ ] Schedule at least 1 short sync (15–20 min) with a peer/mentor for input  
- [ ] Share 1 work-in-progress doc with your team and collect at least 2 comments  
- [ ] Use AI: summarize prior lessons, polish drafts, surface unclear points before sharing  

*** Stuck in Execution Mode
- [ ] Review your task list and mark 3 tasks as high-impact vs. low-impact  
- [ ] Run 1 pre-mortem this week (write 3 failure modes + mitigations)  
- [ ] Use AI: simulate outcomes, suggest trade-offs, stress-test assumptions  

*** Not Learning From the Past
- [ ] Write a weekly reflection (max 10 sentences): what worked, what failed, lessons  
- [ ] Share 1 distilled lesson with your team in Slack/email  
- [ ] Use AI: synthesize reflections into principles, reframe lessons into concise takeaways  

*** Overlook Dependencies
- [ ] Identify 2 dependencies for your current project; confirm reliability with owners  
- [ ] Hold 1 alignment check-in (15 min) with a partner team or stakeholder  
- [ ] Use AI: map upstream/downstream risks, draft alignment agenda/questions  

** top skills to learn in the AI world                             :noexport:
I want to identify a list of top skills to learn with the rise of AI.

Mindset
- Be a learner, adapter, and synthesizer: Knowledge + action + insight = value.
- Leverage AI to amplify, not replace thinking: Tools speed execution; humans provide judgment.
- Embrace uncertainty: AI accelerates change; resilience and curiosity are your superpowers.

Top skills

- Learning How to Learn (Meta-Learning): AI evolves fast; new tools, models, and frameworks appear constantly.
- Human-Centric Insight (Understanding People): AI is a tool; impact comes from solving real human problems.
- Interpersonal & Systems Interaction: AI amplifies output, but collaboration is still key.
- Creative & Strategic Thinking: AI can generate ideas; humans decide which are valuable.
- Adaptability & Flexibility: AI disrupts industries; roles and best practices change quickly.
- Resilience & Growth Mindset: AI projects often fail or produce unexpected outputs.

** Set LLM context
I want to clarify what is truly important to me at work and identify my long-term P0s.

Here’s my context:

1. **Role and Experience**
   - Current role: [Insert role, e.g., Tech Lead in ML Infra]
   - Past growth: [List key strengths and achievements, e.g., business problem focus, cross-team execution, end-to-end ownership, partnership]

2. **Preferences / Values**
   - Marketable skills: [e.g., work should have external recognition or transferability]
   - Energy and stress: [e.g., avoid constant org friction, focus on problem-solving]
   - Work style: [e.g., ownership, high-leverage, measurable impact, ethical partnerships]

3. **Pain Points**
   - [List current frustrations, e.g., high energy spent on problem identification and team alignment, short-lived problem focus]

4. **Goal / Desired Outcome**
   - [Insert long-term goal, e.g., become an ML infra expert with high leverage and low burnout]

Please help me:
- Identify my **core work values** and any conflicts or trade-offs.  
- Surface potential **blindspots or overlooked opportunities**.  
- Suggest what could be my **3-year P0s** based on my context.  
- Provide guidance on **how to filter current workstreams** to align with these P0s.  
- Recommend **strategic milestones** or actions that maximize market value, ownership, and energy efficiency.

Make the output structured and actionable so I can use it to evaluate opportunities, prioritize projects, and plan career growth.
** 3-Year P0 Clarification Procedure
- Define the Vision
   - Decide what success looks like in 3 years for you and your team.
   - Focus on outcomes, not tasks.
- Identify Levers
   - Find areas where focused effort now gives the biggest long-term impact.
- Set P0 Criteria
   - Define what counts as a true long-term P0 to filter initiatives consistently.
- Filter Workstreams
   - Keep only initiatives that meet your P0 criteria.
   - Delegate, pause, or deprioritize the rest.
- Build the Roadmap
   - Break each P0 into multi-year milestones for strategic execution.
- Checkpoints

** prompt - life guidance
Act as a personal life guide and philosophical mentor for me. My goal is to live a peaceful and fulfilled life. Remind me and give advice that helps me:

Release unnecessary mental stress and maintain emotional balance.

Promote a healthy lifestyle for both mind and body.

Avoid over-optimizing or obsessing over things of lesser importance.

Conserve my energy and focus on what truly matters.

Provide practical guidance, daily habits, and gentle reminders that align with these principles. Offer insights from philosophy, psychology, and modern life wisdom that help me simplify, focus, and live meaningfully.

load my local notes below. And create a better prompt. The output should be in English

Here are my notes (between triple backticks):
