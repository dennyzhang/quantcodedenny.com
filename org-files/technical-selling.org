* Enage LLM for improvement                                        :noexport:
I have a draft blog post in org-mode. I want to **continuously improve it**, making it:

1. Clear, concise, and easy to follow.
2. Practical and habit-focused (small, daily actions that are easy to do).
3. Engaging, with examples, tips, or relatable scenarios.
4. Structured and scannable for readers.

Please act as my co-author and do the following:
**Step 1: Analyze**
- Identify overlapping sections, unclear sentences, or redundant points.
- Highlight areas where content could be more practical or actionable.
- Suggest any missing elements that would make it more helpful (e.g., examples, micro-actions, reflections).
**Step 2: Improve**
- Rewrite sentences or sections for clarity and flow.
- Make it more “I”-focused (first-person) if needed.
- Condense overly long sections while keeping essential content.
- Suggest ways to add new, high-value content (tips, mini-case studies, or scenarios).
**Step 3: Expand**
- Add optional content that could enhance the post without overloading the reader (bonus tips, habit variations, illustrative examples).
**Step 4: Present**
- Return the improved blog post in **org-mode format**, ready to copy and paste.
- Include a short note explaining what was changed or added.
**Constraints**
- Keep the post frictionless and practical — readers should be able to apply it daily.
- Avoid making the post too long or complex; prioritize usability over completeness.
- Preserve the original structure where possible (Introduction, Daily Habits, Routine, Reflection, Tips, Common Pitfalls, Conclusion).
- Highlight the changed content with prefix of >>
- Use org-mode format for output

Please help me improve it.

Here is the current version of my post:

Challenge
我觉得拿住不是最难的。难的是如何说服自己all in。这些十倍股你投一万拿十年又如何呢？


Recap
Buy stock on dip
Meta drops to 88 in 2021. I didn’t buy though I believe it is for sure undervalue
Tesla drops to 144 in 2024. I didn’t buy, though I believe it’s for sure undervalue
Buy stock before taking off
Nvidia was 500 in 2023. I didn’t buy since I was not sure whether it’s overvalued
Tesla was 200 in July 2024. I could buy 100K, yet I only buy 30K
Doesn’t hold long enough
I hold 100k Bitcoins on 2015 working in TOTVSLabs

目标
多交朋友，有深度交流
提高mindset
Growth mindset 
Goal driven 
减少精神内耗，道德绑架
抱着“我弱我有理”的态度去进行道德绑架
不需要维护：我是好人
I’m not a victim. I can make the change 
一定不要把自己放在‘受害者’的位置上，因为我们默认有罪的人才需要改变，一旦你坐定了‘受害者’的位置，就容易强调别人的责任、外界的环境，而自己心安理得地不行动

难处
没有空余时间，不自由
没有松弛感，时刻被工作压力包围

机会
多多使用先进技术： AI



经验总结
不要让别人总是免费从你这里拿走好处
“只吃一次亏”原则：先相信对方，但只要通过观察确认对方是不值得交往的，就立刻远离
事情来了，要问自己三句话—— 要做什么？ 怎么做？该找谁？
稻盛和夫曾经有言：“我们工作的最终目的是提升心性，磨砺灵魂，活出不一样的人生，所谓赚钱，只不过是顺便为之。

Denny top priority: deep conversations, enjoy daily work, build unique value, more freedom
Achieve more and faster

 Mission#1: Deep conversations 
Effective listener
Clearly Understand questions, opinions, suggestions. Both the surface level and underlined level
Learn new ideas from others
Having your own opinions
Authentic thoughts with reasoning
Deep thoughts with firsthand research
Share, ask critical questions
Provide value: emotion and intellectual
Techniques: 总结实用的开头语和场景pattern
我给妻子的建议是，每次沟通先说“我知道你过去生活不容易，也是为了咱们这个家好才节省的”
给丈夫的建议是，每次沟通先说“我理解你对于小资生活的向往，这正是我当初追你的理由之一”
Be specific
6 questions in having deep conversations: a/ what do you think? b/ what else c/ what’s the real challenge for you d/ what I can help you e/ what you find useful in today’s conversations
Ask five why to understand the root cause
Ask powerful questions: a/ intention. I’m willing to know you b/ rapport. I see you c/ openness. I hear you d/ listening. I get you. E/ empathy. With you.
Caveat
Avoid being passive aggressive. Instead of why…(people implies to defense), how to … (drive actionable improvements)


Mission #2: enjoy daily work
Energy management
sleep, exercise, reading
Energy management: Make less decision
人们都太想改变别人，太不想改变自己了。改变自己不改变别人，可以省去很多烦恼
如何让人改变的智慧：你要先假设他是对的。只有在对的方向上，人才愿意变得更好
Only optimize the critical parts
如果问题不重要，优化它就是浪费资源，或者应该delegate给别人。比如：孩子的精致饮食，陪伴时的过度保护。
生活中做减法
不用擅长家务
需要更少，更实惠的服务
好的生活习惯
早上六点出门，锻炼半小时。晚上陪崽睡觉
消肚子，注意肠胃
晚上和空闲时间不开手机
Don’t compare with others
每个人的情况和目标不一样。有些人为了事业可以每周把孩子放在daycare七
把工作变成爱好
Emotion Management
不轻易上头
Collaborate for a bigger wins
Goal driven
重燃心中的光



Mission #3 build unique value
不断提高自我认知
Self confidence
Undervalue your team
strategic improvement 
杂事太多，没有安排自我提升时间
拒绝PUA和自我PUA
Don’t sabotage yourself
不是将环境对自己的负面影响都解读为“我不够好，如果我能力更强，就一定可以克服”的自我攻击
handy技能
Ai工具


Feature management API
Give people an anchor to leverage. Explain what problems you can help

Mission #4 more freedom
更多的时间
松弛感
passive income
side business
不要在小事精明，大事糊涂





Main challenge
No free time
很难闲下来。来个朋友，很难招待
没有松弛感
很紧绷






你让人舒服的程度，决定着你所能抵达的高度

明白自己的核心诉求是什么，与他人的边界在哪里

人最重要的是建立属于自己的一套规则，只要自己认为是对的

“花半秒钟就看清事物本质的人和一辈子也看不清的人，注定是截然不同的人生。”

一个人的事业是否成功，有15％取决于他的智商，而其余85％则取决于他的表达能力

首先要保证自己的生存，这不是自私，这就是自然的法则。

Caveat
在边界模糊的工作，这种工作你只要承担一次开了口子，后面这个事就可能自动归你做了，你要是不做，别人就会抱怨。



钱才是最大的底气

足够爱自己，才能更好地爱你爱的人

不吃没有意义的苦。如果吃苦真的让你学到了东西，就值得

养成向自己提问的习惯：你学到了什么；这经验怎么用；你的评价是什么。

快乐和存款一样，是需要积攒的。

保养不是花许多钱才能做到的，而是要认真对待自己，作息规律，好好吃饭，认真清洁，不糊弄自己，情绪不过夜，有事积极处理

不要让自己廉价，一旦接受了廉价的定位，会带来麻烦。

真正厉害的人都不说难听的话

钱的本质是时间。要像花钱一样去花时间

没有任何人的帮助是理所应当的。包括父母兄弟和朋友

别人越相信他，他对自己就越负责

Your manager and TLs may claim you know something or responsbile for something, which you are not.

If you don't clarify it immediately, it will become expectation on you. Then you need to spend energy to catch up this expectation.

Is it very common in tech company? What are the good practice on this? I don't want to be seen as too conservative. I don't want to be over-commit for things I'm not comfortable neither

Why this happens:
- Ambiguous domains → Managers or TLs project expectations onto the person who seems most capable.
- Silence = implicit agreement → If you don’t clarify immediately, they assume you “own it.”
- Teams move fast → People fill gaps by assumption, not by confirmation.
- High performers get loaded → If you’re competent, people assume you can take more.

Good patterns to respond
- Mirror + calibrate: Let me repeat back my understanding to make sure we're aligned ...
- Capacity framing: Here is what I can take on, given the priorities we agreed on.
- deinf your boundary explictly :My role is ..., ownership of ... sits better with ... because ... I can support by ...
*** [#A] Unaligned Priority Injections
Seniors & Leadership: Can we quickly add this? It’s important.

If we take X, timeline for Y shifts by Z.

Working deeply in ML Infra (like Meta or Google) can make your skills feel too specialized. You solve critical problems — but the broader market may not see your full capability.
The key is to **grow visibility and generalize impact organically**, through habits you already do daily.
** Core Principles
- **Think End-to-End** → Connect your work to business goals, reliability, and system health.
- **Focus on Non-Urgent Impact** → Block time weekly to fix recurring pain or document key learnings.
- **Translate to Market Value** → Frame results in measurable terms (revenue, cost, scale, reliability).
- **Learn and Share** → Write short notes or posts to spread knowledge and show thought leadership.
** Regular Routine
*** Weekly Habits
- [ ] **Learn broadly** → Attend 1 SEV or design review; observe recurring problems and system tradeoffs.
- [ ] **Connect cross-functionally** → Chat with 1 XFN lead to understand context and dependencies.
- [ ] **Reflect & share** → Write 1–3 bullet summary of key learning; note patterns, scripts, or principles.
*** Monthly Habits
- [ ] **Host & lead** → Run 1 design or postmortem discussion; practice influence, articulation, and framing decisions.
- [ ] **Mentor** → Coach 1–2 engineers; amplify impact and demonstrate multiplier behavior.
*** Quarterly Habits
- [ ] **Ship a measurable improvement** → Deliver 1 end-to-end enhancement; design for scale, reliability, and visibility.
- [ ] **Summarize impact** → Convert results into metrics or story for internal/external visibility.
*** Focus Blocks & Best Practices
- Protect 1–2 hours weekly for **important but non-urgent work**: blindspot review, systemic improvements, or skill expansion.
- Frame all incidents/projects with **business impact**: root cause, mitigation, downstream effect, prevented loss or restored capacity.
- Ask **system-level questions** before implementation: downstream effects, hidden dependencies, assumptions, failure modes.
- **Document & share patterns** weekly: recurring issues, scripts, or solutions that others can reuse.
- Use external framing: translate internal improvements into **transferable, marketable impact**.
** Watch Out For
- Local optimizations without system or business context.
- Not documenting key decisions.
- Avoiding cross-team or ambiguous problems.
- Over-relying on internal tech; always extract general principles.

** Introduction
As an IC6 ML Infra Tech Lead, technical expertise alone is not enough. I need to be seen as a **leader** — someone who drives impact, earns trust, and inspires confidence across teams.

Leadership presence is about **how I show up, influence decisions, and make work visible**, especially under pressure. This post gives me a **daily-ready framework** to strengthen my leadership presence, including verbal, non-verbal, and mindset practices.

---
** Core Principles
- **Be Calm and Clear Under Pressure**
  - I speak clearly and stay composed during crises.
  - I focus on facts and root causes, avoiding blame.
  - I summarize chaos into actionable next steps.
  - I model humility: “I don’t know yet, but I’ll find out.”
  - I protect the psychological safety of others.

- **Be Visible Without Boasting**
  - I share results and challenges concisely.
  - I focus on impact, not activity.
  - *Mini Habit:* Daily 1-sentence log of the day’s key contribution.

- **Frame Complexity as Leadership**
  - I highlight difficult trade-offs I managed and decisions I influenced.
  - *Template:* “This was challenging because [obstacle]. I enabled [team/org] to succeed by [action].”

- **Influence Through Credibility**
  - I let allies and cross-functional partners reinforce my contributions.
  - I actively recognize others and connect my work to organizational priorities.

- **Guide Decisions, Don’t Just Report**
  - I focus on outcomes and next steps, not every detail.
  - *Template:* “The key takeaway is [message]. I propose [next step]. Impact: [metric].”

- **Consistently Deliver and Communicate**
  - I pair execution with visibility.
  - I regularly summarize progress for managers, peers, and stakeholders.

- **Enhance Non-Verbal Presence**
  - I maintain open posture and relaxed gestures to signal confidence.
  - I use steady, clear, and well-paced voice; avoid filler words.
  - I practice pauses to let key points sink in.
  - *Mini Exercise:* Record 1–2 minutes of daily updates or rehearsal and self-review body language and tone.

---
** Senior leads Mindset
- **Think Strategically & Prioritize Impact**
  - I focus on long-term value and measurable outcomes, not just tasks.
- **Make Invisible Work Visible**
  - I surface hidden complexity, risk, and effort, translating it into clear business or operational value.
- **Empower & Elevate the Team**
  - I enable others to succeed, recognize contributions, and ensure collective ownership.
- **Turn Delivery into Lasting Ownership**
  - I document charters, processes, and systems so projects have ongoing impact.
- **Build Calm Credibility & Influence**
  - I stay composed under pressure, guide decisions, and proactively engage allies to amplify impact.

---
** Daily Habits for Leadership Presence
- **Morning (5 min)**
  - Review yesterday’s work.
  - Identify **one key contribution or decision** to highlight.
  - Decide if any **ally or stakeholder** should be informed.
  - Quick body/voice warm-up: posture check, 1-minute clear articulation of top message.

- **During Work**
  - Capture **complexity, blockers, and learning** in a personal log.
  - When making design or system decisions, note **why the decision matters** for team/org goals.
  - Apply calm, credible behavior during crises: focus on facts, summarize chaos, protect others psychologically.
  - Use controlled gestures and deliberate pacing in meetings or calls.

- **End of Day (5 min)**
  - Fill in the **impact → complexity → credibility** flow:
    1. What impact did I create?
    2. What complexity or trade-offs did I handle?
    3. Who should be aware or can amplify this work?
  - Optional: 1-minute voice/body reflection or recording to self-calibrate.

- **Weekly (10–15 min)**
  - Summarize top 1–2 achievements.
  - Share structured updates with manager or cross-functional stakeholders.
  - Identify allies who can **echo your contributions**.
  - Practice 5–10 minutes of voice/body exercises: posture, tone, pacing, hand gestures.

---
** Practical Templates
- **1-Sentence Daily Log:**
  > “By [action], I [impact] despite [challenge], and [ally/team] is aware.”

- **Decision-Focused Update:**
  > “Key takeaway: [message]. Next step: [action]. Impact: [metric].”

---
** Common Pitfalls
- Overdoing self-promotion damages trust.
- Not surfacing **business value** makes work look like mere execution.
- Not surfacing **complexity & learning** undervalues effort.
- Staying invisible leads to missed recognition and opportunities.
- Focusing on busyness instead of impact dilutes reputation.

---
** Conclusion
Leadership presence is **not superficial** — it’s how I show up, influence, and make work visible while empowering others.
**Daily Habit:** Every day, I ask myself:
1. What **impact** can I highlight?
2. What **complexity & learning** did I uncover?
3. Who do I need to involve or inform to **build credibility**?

By following this **framework + mindset + daily habits**, I make my leadership **visible, trusted, and lasting**, while reducing overthinking.
* Stress Less, Lead Better

As a tech lead, I want to ease mental stress and handle conflicts effectively.
This is my daily runbook for calm, clear, and high-leverage leadership.
** Core Principles (Memorable)
- **Pause Before Reacting**: Avoid knee-jerk responses.
- **Listen First**: Understand before responding.
- **Focus on Outcomes**: Prioritize shared goals, not ego.
- **Protect Boundaries**: Say no or redirect low-leverage work.
** Daily Action Routine
- **Morning (Start of Day)**: Review top 3 priorities; decide what to say "no" to.
- **Pre-Meeting**: Pause, breathe, note intended outcome.
- **During Conflict**: Listen fully; restate understanding before replying.
- **Work Blocks (≈90 mins)**: Take 5 min stretch/walk break.
- **Midday**: Hydrate, check posture, reset focus.
- **End of Day**: Log one win and one boundary I defended.
** Difficult Situations & Quick Actions
- **Disagreement on Priorities**: Frame trade-offs; explain business impact.
- **Boundary-Pushing Requests**: Acknowledge importance; suggest better owner; offer light support.
- **Cross-Team / Peer Conflict**: Listen, validate points, defuse tension, propose joint follow-up.
- **Escalations from Leadership**: Communicate facts clearly; outline immediate + long-term fix.
** Show Calm Through Signals
- Speak calmly; tone sets team baseline.
- Pause before responding; silence = confidence.
- Start with the point; avoid long background.
- Use ownership language: “I’ll handle this.”
- Ask curious, open questions: “Can you walk me through your thinking?”
- Reframe issues positively: “We can fix this early.”
** Energy & Focus Killers (Clustered)
- **Health Basics**: Poor sleep, nutrition, hydration, or movement → fatigue & brain fog.
- **Scattered Focus**: Multitasking & context switching → low efficiency.
- **Stress Ignored**: Bottling emotions → chronic depletion.
- **Weak Boundaries**: Overcommitting → diluted impact, burnout.
- **Environment**: Clutter, noise, bad lighting → lower alertness.
** Best Practices (Actionable)
- **Sleep & Move**: 7–9 hrs sleep; walk/stretch/exercise.
- **Eat & Hydrate**: Balanced meals; avoid sugar spikes; drink water.
- **Prioritize & Batch**: MITs / Eisenhower; avoid overcommitment.
- **Take Microbreaks**: 5–10 mins every 60–90 mins; reflect or journal.
- **Optimize Environment**: Light, tidy, comfortable.
- **Communicate Effectively**: Neutral, “we” language, summarize agreements, use Pause → Clarify → Respond → Follow-Up.
** Common Pitfalls
- Reacting instantly under stress.
- Treating conflict as win/lose.
- Assuming shared context.
- Taking low-leverage work just to be helpful.

    - Focus on problems where my technical expertise creates the most leverage; spend less time on areas outside my control (e.g., headcount, politics).
    - Proactively prioritize high-impact technical challenges instead of reacting to every request.
    - Build guardrails and scalable solutions to reduce firefighting.
    - Set clear boundaries: avoid over-committing and delegate or decline tasks others can own.
2. **Personal Strategies (Manage my mind & energy)**: Strengthen resilience to handle unavoidable stress.
    - Develop habits to stay focused and centered under pressure.
    - Protect time and energy for deep work and recovery.
    - Maintain clarity: sustained impact comes from resilience and focus, not from spreading myself thin.

Working deeply in ML Infra (like Meta or Google) can make your skills feel too specialized. You solve critical problems — but the broader market may not see your full capability.
The key is to **grow visibility and generalize impact organically**, through habits you already do daily.
** Understanding Interests vs. Positions
***TODO:** Expand with real-life examples
- Positions are what people say they want.
- Interests are why they want it.
- Asking "why" questions helps uncover underlying motivations.

** Expanding the Pie: Creating Value
- Brainstorm multiple solutions before negotiating.
- Focus on solutions that cost you little but help the other party.
- Example: If your team needs resources and leadership wants fast delivery, explore temporary staffing or automation.

** Strategic Concessions
- Trade things that are low cost for you but high value for them.
- Always aim to ask for something in return.
- Example: "I can support your project if you help me with X later."

** Framing Shared Wins
- Explicitly show benefits for all parties.
- Practice drafting talking points or emails that highlight mutual gains.
- Example: "This approach reduces errors for your team and meets our deadlines."

** Practice in Low-Stakes Environments
- Apply the principles to family decisions, small purchases, or team tasks.
- Treat each negotiation as a mini-experiment.
- Reflect: Did both sides feel good? Could more value have been created?

** Post-Mortem and Continuous Improvement
- Keep a **Win-Win Journal**: 1–2 entries per week.
- Analyze:
  - Interests of both sides
  - Value created
  - Satisfaction of both parties
  - Lessons for next time

** Tools and Frameworks
- **BATNA** – Know your alternatives.
- **ZOPA** – Identify the zone of possible agreement.
- **Principled Negotiation** – Fisher & Ury’s *Getting to Yes* framework.

** TODO Future Improvements
- Add real-life case studies.
- Include examples from work and family scenarios.
- Add diagrams showing negotiation flow.

** Conclusion
Practicing win-win deals is a **skill that compounds over time**. By focusing on interests, creating value, and reflecting continuously, you can negotiate outcomes that strengthen relationships and achieve shared success.

For a successful tech lead, there are four steps: [[https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/scope-better/][scope better]] -> do better -> [[https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/look-better/][look better]] -> [[https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/connect-better/][connect better]].

Scoping work effectively is one of the hardest skills I’ve learned as a tech lead. I frame scoping around four core challenges:
1. Identifying high-leverage problems.
2. Setting boundaries and protecting focus.
3. Aligning stakeholders and expectations.
4. Align early, iterate fast.
** Using LLMs To Scope Better
I use LLMs to address each core challenge efficiently:

- **Challenge #1: Identifying high-leverage problems**
  - **LLM Use:** Summarize strategy documents, leadership updates, past project data to highlight gaps or opportunities.
  - **Sample Prompt:** "Summarize key priorities from the last 3 leadership updates and highlight conflicts or dependencies for model serving infra."

- **Challenge #2: Aligning stakeholders & clarifying ownership**
  - **LLM Use:** Map dependencies, trade-offs, and responsibilities across teams; highlight potential misalignments.
  - **Sample Prompt:** "Compare three ML infra designs and list technical and organizational trade-offs, including team dependencies and approval requirements."

- **Challenge #3: Managing execution complexity**
  - **LLM Use:** Summarize recurring failures, generate checklists, simulate outcomes, propose mitigations.
  - **Sample Prompt:** "Analyze the last 3 SEVs, summarize recurring failure patterns, and suggest automated mitigation strategies."

- **Challenge #4: Scaling influence and aligning early**
  - **LLM Use:** Draft proposals, mock scenarios, polish communications, extract repeatable lessons.
  - **Sample Prompt:** "Create a mock SEV scenario for IC5, highlighting operational risks. Draft a proposal showing why early alignment and iterative experiments reduce delivery risks."
** Core Challenge #1: Identifying High-Leverage Problems
- **Problem:** It’s easy to spend time on low-impact tasks or local optimizations.
- **Bottlenecks:** Difficulty assessing org-wide impact, repetitive small pain points, ambiguous opportunities.
- **Principle:** Focus on system-level, multi-team, or multi-user problems where my expertise creates leverage.
- **How I Address It:** Score candidate work by scalability, visibility, and alignment with org goals; validate assumptions early; run lightweight experiments.
** Core Challenge #2: Setting Boundaries & Protecting Focus
- **Problem:** Workload grows faster than capacity; distractions from minor requests or low-leverage tasks.
- **Bottlenecks:** Social pressure, fear of missing opportunities, unclear prioritization.
- **Principle:** Clarify P0s, say no strategically, and avoid firefighting on unimportant tasks.
- **How I Address It:** Explicitly define P0s, communicate priorities, delegate or defer non-critical requests, revisit alignment quarterly.
** Core Challenge #3: Aligning Stakeholders & Expectations
- **Problem:** Misalignment leads to wasted effort, repeated clarifications, and delays.
- **Bottlenecks:** Complex org structures, unclear ownership, conflicting incentives, leadership signals not fully transparent.
- **Principle:** Ensure everyone understands “what” and “why,” and map dependencies proactively.
- **How I Address It:** Use concise one-pagers, map trade-offs, preempt conflicts, tap existing leadership structures, and seek authentic feedback from stakeholders.
** Core Challenge #4: Align Early, Iterate Fast
- **Problem:** Delays or misaligned work occur when assumptions go untested or communication is late.
- **Bottlenecks:** Pressure to deliver fast, unclear expectations, fragmented focus.
- **Principle:** Align early on assumptions and goals; iterate quickly based on feedback.
- **How I Address It:** Summarize assumptions in one-pagers, run lightweight experiments, seek early feedback from stakeholders, adjust course weekly.
** Principles for Scoping Better
Protect my time and focus on what truly matters:

- **Clarify and limit P0s**
  - Scenario: Choosing between system-level vs. local improvements, prioritizing multi-team features.
  - Bottlenecks: Estimating org-wide impact, stakeholder pressure, fear of missing smaller opportunities.
  - How: Score candidate work by org-wide impact, scalability, and personal leverage; confirm alignment with stakeholders; revisit quarterly.

- **Say no strategically**
  - Scenario: Requests outside my domain, minor performance tweaks, firefighting, conflicting stakeholder requests.
  - Bottlenecks: Social pressure, judging relative importance, risk of appearing uncooperative.
  - How: Communicate P0 alignment clearly, delegate or defer non-critical requests, document boundaries to avoid repeated interruptions.

- **Validate early and iterate**
  - Scenario: Ambiguous feature proposals, unclear data requests, untested process changes, or missed deadlines due to over-scoping.
  - Bottlenecks: Uncertainty about feasibility, pressure to deliver fast, overconfidence in assumptions, lack of reflection time.
  - How: Summarize assumptions and expected impact in a one-pager; run lightweight experiments; align early with stakeholders; do weekly reflection capturing successes, bottlenecks, and missed P0s; adjust focus and communicate updates.

- **Focus on systemic leverage**
  - Scenario: Spending time on low-leverage tasks or local optimizations instead of multi-team or multi-user improvements.
  - Bottlenecks: Difficulty assessing cross-team impact, repeated small pain points, ambiguous opportunities.
  - How: Prioritize tasks where technical expertise creates outsized impact; skip low-value or doomed-to-fail problems; continuously check alignment with org goals.
** My Desire & Strength
**My Desire**
I aim to establish myself as a tech lead in ML infra with two main objectives:
- Work with **market value**: focus on skills and outcomes recognized externally.
- Minimize **mental stress**: maintain well-being while delivering high impact.
**My Core Strengths**
- **Self-Accountability**: Own work and choices, ensuring clarity in outcomes.
- **Resiliency**: Adapt strategies and maintain focus under obstacles.
- **Impact-Driven Execution**: Prioritize opportunities with measurable business wins.
- **Collaborative Partnership**: Align effectively with peers and cross-functional teams.
** Recent Key Learnings
I’ve distilled key lessons into a few rich-context examples:

- **Leverage leadership and structures**
  - Scenario: Attempted bottom-up charter building, but XFN teams had dedicated roles (reliability, efficiency, DevX).
  - Learning: Tap existing leadership and structures early to avoid prolonged struggles.

- **Set bigger, strategic goals**
  - Scenario: Focused on incremental HD feature cleanup instead of holistic improvements.
  - Learning: Aim for system-level impact over local optimizations.

- **Focus on high-impact technical challenges**
  - Scenario: Spent energy on low-leverage issues like headcount conflicts or minor operational inefficiencies.
  - Learning: Invest where technical expertise creates the most difference; skip low-impact or doomed-to-fail problems.

- **Be confident and assertive in requests**
  - Scenario: Accepted deprioritization of output validation and serving checks.
  - Learning: Advocate confidently for necessary changes rather than acquiescing passively.

- **Generalize problems and share knowledge**
  - Scenario: Solved problems in isolation, missing repeatable patterns across teams.
  - Learning: Step back, find patterns, and share insights broadly for systemic improvement.

** Introduction
For a successful tech lead, it usually has four steps: [[https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/scope-better/][scope better]] -> do better -> [[https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/look-better/][look better]] -> [[https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/connect-better/][connect better]].

Working hard alone isn’t enough. Leaders and decision-makers are busy — if they don’t see my impact, it might as well not exist.

Looking better at work is not self-promotion. It’s about making my contributions **visible, credible, and trusted**. I focus on three things:

- **Business Impact** – What tangible results did I achieve?
- **Complexity & Learning** – What challenges did I overcome, and what did I learn?
- **Credibility** – Did the right people notice my work, and did I involve or acknowledge others?

This post gives me a **daily-ready framework** to apply these principles with minimal thinking.
** Core Principles (3-Minute Shortcut)
- **Impact First**
  - I focus on results, not effort. I quantify outcomes (dollars, time, efficiency) and link them to team or company goals.
  - *Template:* “By doing X, I [saved $Y / improved efficiency by Z% / avoided a risk].”

- **Complexity & Learning**
  - I make hidden challenges and lessons visible. I highlight new skills, methods, or tools that improve future work.
  - *Template:* “This was challenging because [obstacle], and I solved it by [approach]. Learned: [key insight].”

- **Credibility**
  - Feedback from peers is more credible than self-promotion. I share updates, recognize others, and ensure the right people see my work.
  - *Template:* “Thanks to [ally/team], I achieved this result. I shared the approach with [stakeholders].”
** Project Complexity Checklist
- **Challenges & Hurdles**
  - [ ] I highlight major obstacles (technical, organizational, cross-team)
  - [ ] I explain how I solved them or mitigated risks

- **Learning & Innovation**
  - [ ] I capture new skills, methods, frameworks, or tools
  - [ ] I show how they benefit future projects or others

- **Dependencies & Coordination**
  - [ ] I note key dependencies and how I managed them

- **Secondary Impact**
  - [ ] I highlight outcomes beyond immediate metrics (efficiency gains, knowledge transfer)
** Daily & Weekly Runbook
- **Daily (2–5 min)**
  - I pick yesterday’s work and apply the **Impact → Complexity → Credibility** flow.
  - I fill the templates quickly.
  - Optional: I note challenges or insights in a personal log.

- **Weekly (10–15 min)**
  - I review my log and pick 1–2 visible achievements.
  - I share a structured update using templates with my manager, team, or cross-functional stakeholders.
  - I identify allies who can amplify my impact.
** Common Pitfalls
- Overdoing self-promotion damages trust.
- Not surfacing **business value** makes my work look like mere execution.
- Not surfacing **complexity & learning** undervalues my effort.
- Staying invisible leads to missed recognition and opportunities.
- Focusing on busyness instead of impact dilutes my reputation.
** Conclusion
Looking better at work is **not superficial** — it’s telling the full story of my contributions.
**Daily Habit:** Every day, I ask myself:
1. What **impact** can I highlight?
2. What **complexity & learning** did I uncover?
3. Who do I need to involve or inform to **build credibility**?

By following this **checklist + templates**, I make my work **visible, valued, and remembered** without overthinking.

** Introduction
For a successful tech lead, it usually has four steps: [[https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/scope-better/][scope better]] -> do better -> [[https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/look-better/][look better]] -> [[https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/connect-better/][connect better]].

Doing great work is only part of success. My influence grows when others know, trust, and rely on me.

Connecting better at work is most powerful when it becomes a **small daily habit** — one or two simple actions that naturally build trust, relationships, and impact.
** Core Daily Habit
Each day, I focus on **one key action**:

- **Notice & Add Value** – Do at least one of these per day:
  - Ask a thoughtful question to understand someone’s priorities or challenges.
  - Share a useful resource, tip, introduction, or recognition.

- **Follow Through** – Complete or update one commitment each day.
  - If I can’t complete it, I proactively communicate the update.
** Daily Routine (2–3 min each)**
- **Morning:** Pick one person to check in with or help today.
- **During Day:** Apply **one core daily habit** naturally.
- **End of Day:** Log one insight or follow-up for tomorrow; optionally send a quick thank-you or recognition.
** Weekly Reflection (5 min)**
- Who did I meaningfully connect with this week?
- What one helpful action did I take for each person?
- Plan one simple connection action for next week.
** Quick Tips
- Small, consistent actions beat rare grand gestures.
- Focus on **helping others achieve their goals**, not just visibility.
- Keep notes in one place for easy follow-up.
** Common Pitfalls
- Focusing only on networking for personal gain feels transactional.
- Skipping follow-ups reduces trust.
- Ignoring listening or empathy weakens connections.
** Conclusion
Connecting better at work is both a **skill and a habit**. I make it automatic with **one simple action per day**: **notice, add value, or follow through**.

At the end of each week, I reflect briefly: **Who did I understand better, help, or stay connected with, and what simple action will strengthen the connection next week?**
