Introduction
In most workplaces, working hard alone isn’t enough. Leaders and decision-makers are busy,
and if they don’t see your impact, it’s almost as if it never happened.
This is why Patty Azzarello, in her book Rise, emphasizes the idea of “Look Better.”
It’s not about bragging or playing politics. It’s about making sure your real contributions
are visible, credible, and trusted.
Core Principles of Looking Better
Manage Your Reputation Like a Project
Your reputation is the story people tell about you when you’re not in the room.
Don’t leave it to chance.">

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In most workplaces, working hard alone isn’t enough. Leaders and decision-makers are busy,
and if they don’t see your impact, it’s almost as if it never happened.</p>
<p>This is why Patty Azzarello, in her book <strong>Rise</strong>, emphasizes the idea of “Look Better.”
It’s not about bragging or playing politics. It’s about making sure your real contributions
are visible, credible, and trusted.</p>
<h2 id="core-principles-of-looking-better">Core Principles of Looking Better</h2>
<h2 id="manage-your-reputation-like-a-project">Manage Your Reputation Like a Project</h2>
<p>Your reputation is the story people tell about you when you’re not in the room.
Don’t leave it to chance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask yourself: What three words do I want people to associate with me?</li>
<li>Make sure your daily actions reinforce that story.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: If you want to be known as “reliable under pressure,” communicate progress early,
highlight risks, and show calm problem-solving when issues arise.</p>
<h2 id="show-business-value-not-just-effort">Show Business Value, Not Just Effort</h2>
<p>Leaders care about outcomes, not effort.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of: “We reduced server downtime by 10%.”</li>
<li>Say: “Our work avoided $2M in lost revenue by keeping the site up during peak traffic.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The same work—framed differently—can shift how people perceive your value.</p>
<h2 id="borrow-other-people-s-voices">Borrow Other People’s Voices</h2>
<p>When others talk positively about you, it carries more weight than when you do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build trust with peers and cross-functional partners.</li>
<li>Ask for feedback and encourage them to share it upward.</li>
<li>Recognize others first; reciprocity often follows.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="visibility-self-promotion">Visibility ≠ Self-Promotion</h2>
<p>Visibility means ensuring the right people understand what you’re working on and why it matters.
Practical habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share short progress updates in team forums.</li>
<li>Connect your work to company or team priorities.</li>
<li>Present both wins and lessons learned to build credibility.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="build-long-term-credibility">Build Long-Term Credibility</h2>
<p>Credibility compounds over time. People trust and invest in those who deliver consistently.
This is not about one-off polish but about years of reliable delivery paired with thoughtful communication.</p>
<h2 id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overdoing self-promotion can damage trust.</li>
<li>Staying invisible leads to missed recognition and opportunities.</li>
<li>Focusing on busyness instead of business impact dilutes your reputation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action-steps-checklist">Action Steps / Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define 3 words you want colleagues to associate with you.</li>
<li>Reframe your latest project in business terms.</li>
<li>Identify 1–2 allies who can amplify your work.</li>
<li>Share one visible update this week that ties your work to larger goals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Looking better at work is not superficial. It’s about making sure your hard work
shines through the noise of a busy workplace.</p>
<p>At the end of every project, pause and ask:
<strong>Who needs to see this, and how can I frame it so the real impact is clear?</strong></p>
