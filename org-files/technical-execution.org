* Enage LLM for improvement                                        :noexport:
I have a draft blog post in org-mode. I want to **continuously improve it**, making it:

1. Clear, concise, and easy to follow.
2. Practical and habit-focused (small, daily actions that are easy to do).
3. Engaging, with examples, tips, or relatable scenarios.
4. Structured and scannable for readers.

Please act as my co-author and do the following:
**Step 1: Analyze**
- Identify overlapping sections, unclear sentences, or redundant points.
- Highlight areas where content could be more practical or actionable.
- Suggest any missing elements that would make it more helpful (e.g., examples, micro-actions, reflections).
**Step 2: Improve**
- Rewrite sentences or sections for clarity and flow.
- Make it more “I”-focused (first-person) if needed.
- Condense overly long sections while keeping essential content.
- Suggest ways to add new, high-value content (tips, mini-case studies, or scenarios).
**Step 3: Expand**
- Add optional content that could enhance the post without overloading the reader (bonus tips, habit variations, illustrative examples).
**Step 4: Present**
- Return the improved blog post in **org-mode format**, ready to copy and paste.
- Include a short note explaining what was changed or added.
**Constraints**
- Keep the post frictionless and practical — readers should be able to apply it daily.
- Avoid making the post too long or complex; prioritize usability over completeness.
- Preserve the original structure where possible (Introduction, Daily Habits, Routine, Reflection, Tips, Common Pitfalls, Conclusion).
- Highlight the changed content with prefix of >>
- Use org-mode format for output

Please help me improve it.

Here is the current version of my post:

A living runbook for learning from and giving suggestions to other teams
**Why This Matters**:
Cross-team collaboration is a critical part of tech lead work, yet you’re often asked to give feedback on efforts you don’t fully own or understand.

In these moments, your ability to learn fast, frame thoughtful suggestions, and communicate with empathy defines your credibility.

Good suggestions create momentum and build bridges. Poorly framed ones, even if technically right, can erode trust or stall execution.
** Core Principles
1. Understand Before Suggesting
   - Do the deep dive yourself; validate information.
   - Focus on *what* (goal/outcome), not *how*.
   - Check: Do I understand their goal even with limited context?
   - If not sure, signal limited context upfront: *“I may be missing some context, but…”*

2. Respect People and Context
   - Acknowledge effort before giving input.
   - Match discussion level (process vs details).
   - Treat pushback as a sign of ownership, not resistance.
   - When you disagree, start from curiosity: *“Can you help me understand why this direction works better?”*

3. Keep It Simple and Actionable
   - Avoid information overload.
   - Tie suggestions to metrics and outcomes they care about.
   - Clarify who owns follow-up actions.
   - Check: Are my suggestions relevant, concise, and actionable?
   - Use soft framing to reduce friction:
     - *“One idea to consider…”*
     - *“You might explore…”*
     - *“Here’s what worked for us before — not sure if it applies here.”*

4. Share and Co-Own (Optional)
   - Frame input as collaboration, not correction.
   - Offer help or co-ownership to turn ideas into action.
   - Check: Am I ready to co-own implementation or provide support if needed?
   - Ask permission before diving too deep: *“Would you like thoughts on this tradeoff?”*
   - Build safety for iteration — your goal is to unlock better thinking, not to win arguments.
** Scenarios & How to Engage
*** High-Pressure, Short-Context Scenarios
(Few minutes to give input, limited context)
- **Approach**
  - Focus on the goal or desired outcome.
  - Ask high-leverage, pattern-based questions.
  - Prioritize comments that are high-impact and low-risk.
  - Signal limited context but contribute thoughtfully.
  - Clarify follow-up / ownership if action is triggered.
  - Don’t try to cover everything — aim for clarity, not completeness.

- **Examples**
  - SEV postmortem review
  - Rapid design review
  - Urgent cross-team triage
*** Scenario: Standard Context Scenarios
(More time to explore context)
- **Approach**
  - Deep dive into details if needed.
  - Understand tradeoffs and context fully.
  - Offer concrete suggestions with examples from prior experience.
  - Frame suggestions in alignment with team goals.
- **Examples**
  - Process improvement sharing
  - Quarterly roadmap sync
  - Tooling/infra collaboration

Improving technical writing at work is not about sounding perfect—it’s about being clear, persuasive, and structured. Many daily scenarios (work chats, proposals, meeting invites, project updates, postmortems) require writing that is both professional and leadership-oriented.

To make this easier, I created a **master prompt** that turns raw drafts into polished writing. You simply copy the prompt into your LLM, then add your content with a sub-command like `/invite`, `/update`, or `/proposal`. The system automatically transforms your draft into a refined version with staff+ tone, clear structure, and actionable framing.

Here’s how to use it:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
# Example: Using this prompt

Read https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/improve-technical-writing/

/invite

``` insert your original content, e.g.:

Hi [Names],

I’d like to set up a meeting to align on [topic or initiative].
The goal is to [what decision, alignment, or milestone you want to achieve].

bla bla bla
#+END_SRC
** Set LLM context
You are my **Technical Communication Coach** (staff+ ML infra engineer).
Your job is to improve my writing for daily work scenarios.
I will provide content prefixed by a command.

*** write project update - organize team weekly update
prompt for the problem statement

I have a team of 4. I need to write quarterly team lookback

We have a team weekly update doc. I want to know how to write the lookback quickly with a high quality.

The weekly doc has highlights and lowlights which is good. A few gaps I can see, (I might miss more)
- I also maintain a local doc, which has performance tracking entries yet missing from team doc
- the team doesn't update the metrics, since it doesn't move on a weekly basis. and this is important for leadership communication in the lookback

- different versions: functions not defined; certain functions are not supported
- understand the convention: hugo generate files into docs folder
- no defensive coding which makes debugging difficult
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 默认导出 Markdown 不加 front matter，除非 Org 文件里有特定 property
- For impossible tasks, llm run into a circle instead of admitting a NO.
*** Expert mindset for vibe coding
- Embrace imperfection: treat the LLM as a co-pilot, not a guarantee.
- Iterate fast: copy errors to the LLM and ask for fixes immediately—speed > perfect understanding.
- Meta-awareness: question assumptions about project structure, plugin limitations, or API behavior.
- Build guardrails: small checks, logging, or validation to catch mistakes early.
- Layer knowledge: start with minimal reproducible units (file-level) before scaling to project-level.
- Document gaps: track behaviors, limitations, and “unknown unknowns” to avoid repeating mistakes.
- Continuous learning: refine your workflow based on past errors and successful patterns.
- Plan for LLM limitations: predefine expected outputs, constraints, and acceptable fallbacks.
**** Technical challenges
- Multiple versions: functions may be undefined or unsupported across versions.
- Understanding conventions: e.g., Hugo generates files into the `docs` folder, not `content`.
- Lack of defensive coding: errors propagate, making debugging harder.
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 exports Markdown without front matter by default unless Org file has specific properties.
- LLM behavior: when facing impossible tasks, it often loops endlessly instead of admitting "No."
- Hidden dependencies: some tasks fail because of unmentioned dependencies or outdated libraries.
- Subtle syntax quirks: small differences in Org, Markdown, or Hugo behavior can break automation.
*** Gaps, blind spots & workflow caveats
- Works well for individual files, but not full project structures.
- [#A] You don’t know what you don’t know—and the LLM may not tell you.
- Component limitations arise from business, capability, or incompatibilities:
  - Business: e.g., Twitter free API only allows pulling 100 posts/day.
  - Capability: e.g., Emacs plugin (ox-hugo) only supports Markdown blocks in Org files.
  - Incompatibilities: old methods removed and replaced with incompatible alternatives.
- Assumptions hidden in examples: tutorials or LLM examples often assume a different project layout.
- Don’t overanalyze error messages; capture them and ask the LLM to propose fixes.
- Recognize impossible tasks early—stop LLM loops.
- Treat your Org file as the single source of truth for properties; easier than chasing plugin defaults.
- Version control is essential: track both Org files and exported Markdown to detect regressions.
- Validate outputs frequently: check Hugo build results, Markdown rendering, and front matter correctness.
- Minimize multi-step dependencies when iterating with LLM: isolate failures to one step at a time.
- Keep LLM prompts precise and contextual: vague instructions lead to loops and inconsistent outputs.
