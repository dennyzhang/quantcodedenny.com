System design interviews test not only technical skills but also strategic thinking, end-to-end ownership, scalability awareness, and cross-team influence.
As a high-end IC6 (between IC6 and IC7), my goal is to bridge execution with strategic design thinking. This blog post consolidates my learnings from system design prep, especially for ML Infra contexts, and is designed to evolve as I add new insights.
SWE System Design Leveling – 35 mins
IC5

Independently chooses components to tell a coherent story.
Covers end-to-end design with no significant gaps.
Discusses tradeoffs and user impact, with prompting.

IC6

Creates effective designs addressing multiple critical aspects.
Anticipates problems, including maintainability and organizational challenges.
Speaks thoroughly on tradeoffs, bottlenecks, and user impact with minimal prompting.

IC7

Builds sophisticated designs addressing all stated and implicit parts of a problem.
Proactively considers alternative solutions, immediate vs. long-term issues, and business needs.
Covers all tradeoffs: technical, user impact, team dynamics, reliability, and sustainability.

Core Principles for System Design
1. Problem Structuring

Clarify requirements and constraints (functional &amp; non-functional, SLAs, ownership boundaries, future growth).
Identify critical paths, unknowns, and dependencies.
Use a structured approach to map problem → components → interactions.

2. Trade-Off Awareness

Recognize and quantify trade-offs: latency vs. throughput, consistency vs. availability, cost vs. reliability.
Include business, operational, and cross-team implications.
IC7-level thinking anticipates tangential trade-offs proactively.

3. Known Patterns &amp; Abstractions

Apply reusable patterns: caching, sharding, load balancing, replication, event-driven architectures.
Avoid reinventing solutions; justify deviations clearly.

4. Scalability &amp; Reliability

Horizontal vs. vertical scaling.
Fault tolerance, retries, backpressure handling, recovery strategies.
Monitoring, alerts, and observability planning.
Consider future-proofing and maintainability.

5. Communication &amp; Influence

Present a structured narrative: context → problem → options → trade-offs → recommendation.
Highlight strategic impact, not just technical correctness.
Prepare concise “elevator pitches” for directors, PMs, and cross-functional teams.

IC6 System Design Practice Checklist
Requirements &amp; Clarification

Functional vs. non-functional requirements.
Latency, throughput, SLAs/SLOs.
Ownership boundaries &amp; team responsibilities.
Expected growth &amp; future-proofing needs.

High-Level Design

Identify major components &amp; interactions.
Map data flow (ingestion → processing → serving).
Define APIs, interfaces, and abstractions.
Highlight cross-team dependencies.

Scaling &amp; Reliability

Horizontal vs. vertical scaling.
Caching, sharding, partitioning.
Fault tolerance &amp; retries.
Observability: monitoring, alerting, metrics.

Tradeoffs &amp; Options

Pros/cons of architectural choices.
Cost vs. performance vs. complexity.
Business impact of each option.

Edge Cases / Failure Modes

Identify points of failure and mitigation strategies.
Discuss backpressure, stale data, network issues.
Recovery, retries, fallback logic.

Influence &amp; Communication

Summarize decisions for non-technical stakeholders.
Highlight trade-offs explicitly.
Show strategic impact and maintain leadership presence.

Leadership Presence

Lead calmly and confidently.
Encourage team input while framing final decisions.
Maintain focus on high-leverage improvements.

Lessons Learned from Practice

Quick diagramming of key points improves clarity and retention.
Unknown problem spaces are common; approach them systematically.
High-impact areas: latency, bottlenecks, single points of failure.
Iterate rapidly: draft → validate → refine.
Post-mortem past interviews to note good and bad reasoning.

Context: I am preparing for IC6-level system design interviews (or real-world design discussions) at top tech companies, focusing on ML Infra. My goal is to demonstrate strategic thinking, end-to-end ownership, scalability awareness, and cross-functional influence.

Task:
- Review the content for clarity, completeness, and IC6→IC7 relevance.
- Suggest improvements in requirements clarification, design patterns, scaling, reliability, trade-offs, edge cases, and influence.
- Highlight missing advanced insights or high-leverage discussion points.
- Provide rewritten or refined sections where needed.
