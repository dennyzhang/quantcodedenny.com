** prompt - review unit test case
Find major issues in given unit test code

Find and read both unit test code and implemention code. Common issues include:
1. Lack of mocking remote calls
2. Is actually missing async_test annotation. Then a few test cases don't work as expected, essentially got skipped
3. Missing coverage for critical functions or capabilities

Your answer should:
1. right to the point
2. list detail functions which have issues

Evaluate this: https://abc/tests/test_123.py
** prompt - suggest on diff summary
You are a senior staff-level engineer with excellent technical writing skills.

Your job is to review my diff summary and make it clearer, more persuasive, and professional.

Your output should include:

- Rating of my diff summary (clarity, persuasiveness, readability).
- Three detailed suggestions with concrete examples of how to rephrase or reframe.
- Improved rewritten version of my diff summary that keeps the same technical content but communicates it more clearly.
- Bullet-point summary of what changed and why (so I can learn reusable patterns).

Here is diff summary to review (between triple backticks)

Insert your content here

** prompt - diff review
You are a senior staff-level engineer with excellent technical communication and mentorship skills. Your task is to review my diff summary (or code changes) and provide actionable feedback.

Your output should include:

Clarity Check — Is the diff summary/code easy to understand for reviewers at different levels of familiarity? Suggest improvements.

Persuasiveness Check — Does the explanation justify why the change is necessary and what impact it has? Suggest stronger framing if needed.

Readability & Style — Identify wording, formatting, or structural improvements for better professionalism and readability.

Improved Version — Rewrite the diff summary/code explanation to make it clearer, more concise, and more persuasive while keeping technical accuracy.

Bullet-Point Rationale — Summarize what you changed and why (so I can learn and improve future reviews).

Here is the diff

- different versions: functions not defined; certain functions are not supported
- understand the convention: hugo generate files into docs folder
- no defensive coding which makes debugging difficult
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 默认导出 Markdown 不加 front matter，除非 Org 文件里有特定 property
- For impossible tasks, llm run into a circle instead of admitting a NO.
** Expert mindset for vibe coding
- Embrace imperfection: treat the LLM as a co-pilot, not a guarantee.
- Iterate fast: copy errors to the LLM and ask for fixes immediately—speed > perfect understanding.
- Meta-awareness: question assumptions about project structure, plugin limitations, or API behavior.
- Build guardrails: small checks, logging, or validation to catch mistakes early.
- Layer knowledge: start with minimal reproducible units (file-level) before scaling to project-level.
- Document gaps: track behaviors, limitations, and “unknown unknowns” to avoid repeating mistakes.
- Continuous learning: refine your workflow based on past errors and successful patterns.
- Plan for LLM limitations: predefine expected outputs, constraints, and acceptable fallbacks.

** Technical challenges
- Multiple versions: functions may be undefined or unsupported across versions.
- Understanding conventions: e.g., Hugo generates files into the `docs` folder, not `content`.
- Lack of defensive coding: errors propagate, making debugging harder.
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 exports Markdown without front matter by default unless Org file has specific properties.
- LLM behavior: when facing impossible tasks, it often loops endlessly instead of admitting "No."
- Hidden dependencies: some tasks fail because of unmentioned dependencies or outdated libraries.
- Subtle syntax quirks: small differences in Org, Markdown, or Hugo behavior can break automation.
** Gaps, blind spots & workflow caveats
- Works well for individual files, but not full project structures.
- [#A] You don’t know what you don’t know—and the LLM may not tell you.
- Component limitations arise from business, capability, or incompatibilities:
  - Business: e.g., Twitter free API only allows pulling 100 posts/day.
  - Capability: e.g., Emacs plugin (ox-hugo) only supports Markdown blocks in Org files.
  - Incompatibilities: old methods removed and replaced with incompatible alternatives.
- Assumptions hidden in examples: tutorials or LLM examples often assume a different project layout.
- Don’t overanalyze error messages; capture them and ask the LLM to propose fixes.
- Recognize impossible tasks early—stop LLM loops.
- Treat your Org file as the single source of truth for properties; easier than chasing plugin defaults.
- Version control is essential: track both Org files and exported Markdown to detect regressions.
- Validate outputs frequently: check Hugo build results, Markdown rendering, and front matter correctness.
- Minimize multi-step dependencies when iterating with LLM: isolate failures to one step at a time.
- Keep LLM prompts precise and contextual: vague instructions lead to loops and inconsistent outputs.
