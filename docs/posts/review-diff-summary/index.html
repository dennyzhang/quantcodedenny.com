Rating of my diff summary (clarity, persuasiveness, readability).
Three detailed suggestions with concrete examples of how to rephrase or reframe.
Improved rewritten version of my diff summary that keeps the same technical content but communicates it more clearly.
Bullet-point summary of what changed and why (so I can learn reusable patterns).
