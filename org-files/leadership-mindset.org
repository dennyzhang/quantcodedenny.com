** Set the context
You are a staff+ engineer leading a cross-functional v-team. Your job is to:

- Align incentives and positions.
- Surface constraints and roadblocks.
- Drive execution while managing bandwidth to avoid over-commitment.
- Keep the big picture in mind and ensure work aligns with org goals.
- Adopt a growth-oriented, solution-focused mindset: think strategically, balance ambition with realism, and maintain team trust and energy.

Your response depends on the command prefix:
- /align → Build shared understanding, frame requests in partner teams’ goals.
- /unblock → Identify constraints, propose practical next steps, escalate if needed.
- /execute → Suggest quick wins, step-by-step plans, and manage team load to prevent burnout.
- /update → Craft concise progress updates, highlight alignment, risks, and next steps.
---
** /align → Build Shared Understanding
- Map team incentives, constraints, and positions.
- Highlight common ground and win–win framing.
- Suggest bridge statements for alignment.
- Consider team capacity and avoid pushing excessive commitments.
- Mindset tip: Assume each team wants to succeed; approach with curiosity, not blame.
---
** /unblock → Remove Roadblocks
- Identify root blockers (ownership, resourcing, priorities).
- Propose practical next steps or escalation paths.
- Reframe blockers as shared risks or opportunities.
- Ensure solutions respect team bandwidth and prevent overloading contributors.
- Mindset tip: Focus on solving the system, not assigning fault.
---
** /execute → Drive Tangible Progress
- Suggest quick wins to build momentum.
- Propose step-by-step plans with owners, timelines, and realistic workload.
- Show how progress ties back to org-level goals.
- Balance urgency with sustainable team execution.
- Mindset tip: Prioritize impact over activity; progress doesn’t require doing everything at once.
---
** /update → Communicate Progress
- Craft clear v-team updates: context → progress → risks → next steps.
- Frame updates strategically: highlight impact, alignment, and momentum.
- Include realistic workload and capacity constraints.
- Suggest narrative for leadership or broader audiences.
- Mindset tip: Communicate confidence and clarity while signaling realistic expectations; transparency builds trust.

There are blindspots from the teams
What's the ETA
think from other teams' perspectives

the complain can help us to make more resources

dirty: TL is using this as opportunity to ask funding

different levels of discussions

avoid taking the main blame, while it's collaborative improvements

When make escalation, ensure there is direct 1/1 communication. e.g: In general, I believe feedback should be given directly (ideally a 1:1, not DM) before escalating. Folks should be given the oppty to address themselves.

** good way to escalate                                            :noexport:

* Strategic Thinking In Big Corporate Envs                         :noexport:
Think and discuss at a director-level perspective.

Navigate and balance conflicting goals effectively.

Aim for sustainable solutions rather than quick fixes.

Recognize and address blind spots in plans or strategies.

Frame problems with incentives and “why it matters” to gain alignment.

** local notes
Need to sell well, while

** Focus & Prioritization
Invest energy in critical, high-leverage work over urgent-but-low-value tasks.

Avoid over-investing in less critical issues.

Seek global optimization over local wins, aligning with higher ROI challenges.
** Communication & Discussions
Avoid leaving open-ended threads; drive toward clarity and closure.

Ask framing questions that help the whole team think more broadly.

Ensure comments add unique value after deep thought (avoid noise or obvious remarks).

Encourage meaningful discussions, especially on core problems; don’t prematurely shut them down.

Use simple, concrete language and data to open up topics that engage others.

Deliver hard messages when necessary with clarity and respect.
** Leverage & Empowerment
Contribute unique value instead of competing on the same ground as others.

Mobilize the team to increase overall output, not just personal output.

Gain useful insights by actively engaging with cross-functional partners and your team.

Add value without doing all the work yourself (e.g., ask clarifying questions, provide direction).

Avoid over-delegation that leaves team members unsupported and projects at risk.

Remove collaboration friction by being flexible on approaches and emphasizing business outcomes.
** Influence & Leadership Presence
Grow your influence and power through consistent, value-adding contributions.

Build confidence in the team when facing uncertainty.

Engage actively in discussions to show leadership presence.

Talk with a business sense—connect technical choices to business impact.

Maintain a bias for action to drive progress.

Ensure steady progress forward; momentum builds credibility.
** casual talk
Can I ask that you find a time next week for us

I’m not a big fan of them coming in and claiming that XXX solution should be generalized and pushing for long-term ownership, especially since my understanding was that another group was instrumental in contributing to that solution. That’s why I stepped in to reference the earlier discussions.

** bad habits jeopardize your power
- Avoid overly available for urgencies. Work on critical things over urgent-yet-not-critical things.

** prompt - polish my local notes
You are a senior staff-level mentor and leadership coach.
I want to thrive as a team lead in a large, competitive corporate environment.

Here are my raw personal observations and caveats (between triple backticks). Your job is to:

Synthesize & Expand – Turn my notes into polished, actionable leadership principles.

Structure Clearly – Organize into categories such as Impact & Value, Strategy & Alignment, Influence & Persuasion, Execution & Resilience.

Make Practical – For each principle, add a short example or scenario of how it applies in day-to-day leadership.

Highlight Caveats – Show common pitfalls or failure modes if the principle is ignored.

Aspirational but Realistic – Balance ambition with credibility; advice should feel both motivating and grounded in corporate reality.

Output Format – A structured playbook I can review before making proposals or leading discussions.

Here are my raw notes:

```
My local notes

- Need to show delta value. For big system in big coporate, individuals or individual teams may not be sufficient to fully resolve a complex business problems.
- Clarify what the success would look like
- Understand the opinions and positions for high stakes
- Be determined and strong for your proposals
- Keep doing the same thing as the same complexity doesn't help you level up
  
```
** current challenge
- Leaders will see your work as “busy work” instead of transformative. Your team risks being sidelined for more “high-leverage” projects.
- Team position is very difficult
- Foundation work is hard to quantify impact
** local note
- align the understanding
- clarify your boundary, role & responsibility
- need to be goal oriented. and converstion should be all around moving the goals
- be clear on who own the follow-up, and what is the timeline
** local note: ask for clarification - you mind sharing the reason this inconsistency blocks your diff ?
** local note: ask for more business context
* TODO make suggestions which adds value and drive actions
