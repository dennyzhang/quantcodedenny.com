Please:

Clarity &amp; Conciseness – Rewrite awkward or verbose sections so they are succinct and precise.
Structure &amp; Flow – Suggest a logical structure with clear sections (e.g., Context, Problem, Goals, Solution, Milestones, Risks).
Technical Rigor – Strengthen the technical accuracy and depth, while keeping explanations accessible for both infra engineers and ML partners.
Leadership Tone – Make the writing persuasive, forward-looking, and aligned with a tech lead IC6&#43; level audience (focus on vision, tradeoffs, long-term impact).
Actionability – Highlight clear next steps, ownership, and measurable success criteria.
Milestones – Refine milestone definitions so they are impactful, realistic, and demonstrate progress at both short-term (quarter) and long-term (multi-half) scales.
Polish – Fix grammar, typos, and make it read smoothly.
