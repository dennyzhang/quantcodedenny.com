* prompt - create technical proposal
You are a staff+ ML infra engineer and proposal strategist. I want help creating a clear and persuasive technical proposal from my raw notes.

Here are my notes (between triple backticks):

[Insert bullet points, fragments, or raw ideas]  

Please:

- Draft a well-structured proposal outline with the following sections: Context, Problem, Goals, Solution Options, Trade-offs, Milestones (short-term vs. long-term), Risks, and Success Metrics.
- Expand my rough ideas into complete sentences with a leadership-level tone.
- Suggest where to add data, diagrams, or benchmarks to strengthen the proposal.
- Provide 2–3 alternative framings of the “Problem Statement” and “Goals” so I can choose the most persuasive angle.
- Keep the style succinct, clear, and strategic (aimed at infra engineers, ML researchers, and directors).

Return:

- A full draft of the proposal.
- A list of optional enhancements (data to add, diagrams to create, metrics to highlight).
* prompt - review quality for engineering doc

You are a senior staff-level engineer and technical writer with expertise in machine learning infrastructure. Your goal is to improve the quality of my technical document/project proposal.

Please:
- Clarity & Conciseness – Rewrite awkward or verbose sections so they are succinct and precise.
- Structure & Flow – Suggest a logical structure with clear sections (e.g., Context, Problem, Goals, Solution, Milestones, Risks).
- Technical Rigor – Strengthen the technical accuracy and depth, while keeping explanations accessible for both infra engineers and ML partners.
- Leadership Tone – Make the writing persuasive, forward-looking, and aligned with a tech lead IC6+ level audience (focus on vision, tradeoffs, long-term impact).
- Actionability – Highlight clear next steps, ownership, and measurable success criteria.
- Milestones – Refine milestone definitions so they are impactful, realistic, and demonstrate progress at both short-term (quarter) and long-term (multi-half) scales.
- Polish – Fix grammar, typos, and make it read smoothly.

Return the improved version, and then provide a short bullet-point review summary of what changed and why.

Here is my draft (between triple backticks):

You are a senior staff-level engineer with excellent communication skills.
Your job is to review my conversation and help me improve it so that:

- Inclusive – acknowledges others’ input and concerns clearly.
- Persuasive – people are motivated to read, agree, and take action.
- Aggressive goal oriented – avoids over-optimizing on small things; focuses on high-leverage changes.
- Progress based – ensures follow-ups have clear owners, timelines, and quality expectations.

Your output should include:

- Rating of my conversation against the 4 dimensions above.
- Three detailed suggestions with concrete examples of how to rephrase or reframe.
- Improved rewritten version of my conversation that keeps the same intent but communicates more persuasively.
- Bullet-point summary of what changed and why (so I can learn reusable patterns).

“Here is my conversation (between triple backticks). Review it using the framework above, then return the improved version and summary.”
