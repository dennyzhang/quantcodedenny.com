Use AI to plan smarter trading decisions — systematically, calmly, and without emotional bias.

This post shows structured prompts to improve weekly options strategies, day trading checks, and long-term signal monitoring.
- /cashsecuredput Plan a weekly cash-secured put on RKLB with strikes balancing premium and assignment risk
- /coveredcall Plan a weekly covered call on RKLB with strikes minimizing assignment risk
- /guardrail I plan to buy QQQ at $550
- /tradeanalysis MSFT dip this week / Day trading QQQ today
- /earlyalerts Reddit in tech/social sector
** Commands & Workflows
*** /coveredcall → Weekly Covered Call Planning
Plan a weekly covered call to generate income while controlling assignment risk.

Example prompt:
#+begin_example
/coveredcall Plan a weekly covered call on RKLB with strikes minimizing assignment risk
#+end_example

LLM checklist:
- Recommend strike above current market price based on volatility and chart resistance.
- Estimate probability of being called and premium yield.
- Suggest rolling/exit triggers if price approaches strike.
- Confirm rationale aligns with holding vs. selling preference.

Quick Decision Checklist:
- [ ] Stock not in breakout mode.
- [ ] IV rank > 25% (higher IV = higher premium).
- [ ] Strike 5–10% above current price for low assignment risk.
- [ ] Weekly premium > 0.8% of stock price if possible.
- [ ] Defined plan for rolling or accepting assignment.
*** /cashsecuredput → Weekly Cash-Secured Put Planning
Plan a weekly cash-secured put to accumulate shares at a discount while collecting premium.

Example prompt:
#+begin_example
/cashsecuredput Plan a weekly cash-secured put on RKLB with strikes balancing premium and assignment risk
#+end_example

LLM checklist:
- Suggest strike & expiry balancing yield and assignment probability.
- Estimate premium and probability of assignment.
- Flag event risk (earnings, tariffs, large announcements).
- Remind of capital lockup and required cash to cover assignment.

Quick Decision Checklist:
- [ ] Stock stable or in uptrend.
- [ ] IV rank > 30% (prefer higher IV for better premium).
- [ ] Strike 5–10% below current price.
- [ ] Target 0.8–1.5% weekly ROI (adjust to risk tolerance).
- [ ] No major event risk this week.
*** /earlyalerts → Emerging Signals (6-month horizon)
Scan for early signals in companies/sectors using hiring, patents, filings, and fund flows.

Example prompt:
#+begin_example
/earlyalerts Analyze early signals for Reddit in tech/social sector
#+end_example

LLM checklist:
- Synthesize signals: hiring spikes, patent filings, executive hires, fund inflows.
- Estimate confidence level and suggested monitoring cadence.
- Suggest concrete next steps: filings to watch, KPIs (DAU, revenue indicators).

Quick Decision Checklist:
- [ ] Multiple independent signals (news + hiring + filings).
- [ ] No single-source hype (avoid false positives).
- [ ] Monitoring plan: what to check weekly/monthly.
*** /guardrail → Emotional & Purchase Check (Always run before trades)
Check for FOMO/panic and validate trade reasonableness.

Example prompt:
#+begin_example
/guardrail I want to buy QQQ at $550
#+end_example

LLM output structure:
- Assessment: ✅ (neutral) / ⚠️ (emotional)
- Buy? / Execute?: Yes / No
- Confidence: 0–100%
- Reasoning: Market context, catalysts, volatility, risk factors
- Suggested Price / Execution Adjustments
- Quick Habit: If flagged ⚠️, wait 24 hours or reduce order size / split execution.

Mini Checklist:
- [ ] Is this trade plan-based or reactionary?
- [ ] Are technical or fundamental reasons documented?
- [ ] Is position sizing aligned with risk rules?
*** /tradeanalysis → Dips & Intraday Opportunities
Identify short-term dip buys or intraday setups (QQQ, sector ETFs, or leaders).

Example prompt:
#+begin_example
/tradeanalysis MSFT dip this week
/tradeanalysis Day trading QQQ today
#+end_example

LLM checklist:
- Confirm dip depth vs. recent ranges (5–10% typical dip band).
- Check volume, VWAP, and liquidity for execution feasibility.
- Provide suggested entry range, stop-loss, and profit target.
- Note market-open / close behavior or news events that affect intraday flow.

Quick Decision Checklist:
- [ ] Volume supports the move (no thin liquidity).
- [ ] Entry near support/VWAP with stop below clear level.
- [ ] Reward:risk meets minimum threshold (e.g., 2:1).
- [ ] No conflicting macro/news in the session.
** Weekly & Daily Routine
- Monday: Run `/cashsecuredput` to plan cash-secured puts for the week.
- Thursday/Friday: Run `/coveredcall` to harvest premium if holding shares.
- Daily before trading: Run `/guardrail` for any planned trades; run `/tradeanalysis` for intraday opportunities.
- Weekly: Run `/earlyalerts` to refresh long-term watchlist and re-prioritize ideas.
- Logging: Record rationale, strikes, premiums, outcomes in a simple weekly journal.
** Reflection Prompts (Weekly)
- Did AI help me avoid emotional trades this week?
- Were strike selections consistent with my risk profile?
- What trade(s) deviated from plan and why?
** Universal Rules
- **Tone:** Calm, rational, focused on long-term value.
- **Basis:** Verifiable facts (current prices, historical trends, news).
- **Key Insights:** Include reusable patterns or indicators in each output.
- **No Financial Advice:** Outputs are analytical tools for consideration only.
- **Output Discipline:** Follow each workflow to reinforce habit and consistency.
- Use first-person framing: “I will check /guardrail before executing a trade.”
** Common Pitfalls
- Selling puts on clear downtrends without a trend-reversal thesis.
- Writing calls too close to resistance when you want to keep the stock.
- Ignoring assignment cash requirements for cash-secured puts.
- Trading through major events (earnings, tariffs) without adjustments.
** Key Takeaway
AI enforces structured thinking and consistent habits. Use the commands to run repeatable checks, document decisions, and improve trading quality over time.

** 0 Intro
This tool empowers engineers to automate stock sentiment analysis with
precision and speed.

It combines two core capabilities: parsing recent
news headlines to extract market sentiment and insights, and parsing
SEC filings to surface key financial and risk information. Both
streams are fed into a configurable LLM pipeline, allowing you to run
fast local tests with lightweight models or perform high-accuracy
production analysis. Designed for modularity and reuse, it integrates
seamlessly into your workflows—turning raw data into actionable
insights without manual reading.

Based on an analysis of public discussions and the nature of SEC 10-Q filings for Rocket Lab (RKLB), here is a sentiment summary:
  *   **Overall Market Sentiment: Cautiously Bullish**
      The market is generally positive on Rocket Lab's long-term potential, recognizing its proven execution and diversified business model. However, this optimism is tempered by the capital-intensive nature of new rocket development and the company's current lack of profitability. The sentiment hinges on future execution rather than current financials.
  
  *   **Top 3 Sentiment Drivers:**
      1.  **Neutron Rocket Development:** Progress on the next-generation, reusable Neutron rocket is the single largest catalyst. Positive news on engine testing, manufacturing milestones, and development timelines drives bullish sentiment, as it promises access to a much larger and more lucrative launch market.
      2.  **Space Systems Growth:** The performance of the Space Systems division (satellite components, spacecraft manufacturing) is a critical driver. Strong, high-margin revenue growth in this segment diversifies the company away from launch-only risk and provides a clearer, nearer-term path to profitability.
      3.  **Financial Execution & Cash Burn:** SEC filings like the 10-Q are closely watched for revenue growth, gross margins, and cash burn. While losses are expected during this growth phase, investors are sensitive to the rate of cash consumption and management's commentary on the timeline to achieve positive cash flow.
  
  *   **Suggested Action for a Long-Term Tech Investor: Watch**
      Monitor progress on the key drivers listed above, particularly Neutron development milestones and margin improvement in the Space Systems segment. A consistent track record of hitting development targets would be a strong signal to initiate or add to a position.
  
  Based on an analysis of recent news, social media discussions, and the provided SEC filing information for Rocket Lab (RKLB) over the past week:
  
  *   **SEC Filing Note:** The provided SEC filing (`0001628280-25-038936.txt`) is a 10-Q for the period ending June 30, **2025**. As this is a future-dated document, its contents cannot be used for an analysis of current events and are disregarded in this summary.

  ### **RKLB Analysis: Past Week**
  
  *   **Overall Sentiment: Bullish**
      *   Discussions reflect strong optimism about the company's long-term trajectory, focusing on execution and future growth catalysts, despite broader market volatility.
  
  *   **Top 3 Reasons Driving Sentiment:**
      1.  **Neutron Rocket Development Progress:** Continued tangible progress on the Neutron rocket, including updates on the Archimedes engine, tank production, and launch site construction in Wallops, Virginia, is the primary driver of long-term bullish sentiment. This progress reinforces confidence in the company's ability to compete in the medium and heavy-lift launch market.
      2.  **Consistent Execution & Launch Cadence:** Rocket Lab maintains a high flight tempo with its Electron rocket, successfully completing missions for customers like NASA. This operational success generates consistent revenue and demonstrates reliability, which is frequently highlighted as a key differentiator.
      3.  **Expansion of Space Systems Segment:** The market is increasingly recognizing the strength of Rocket Lab's Space Systems division, which provides satellite components and manufacturing. Recent contract wins and a growing backlog in this segment showcase a diversified and resilient business model beyond just launch services.
  *   **Suggested Action for a Long-Term Tech Investor: Buy**
     *   The company is executing on its core business while making clear, verifiable progress on its next-generation platform (Neutron) that promises significant growth. For a long-term investor with a tolerance for the high-growth space sector, current price levels are viewed by many as an attractive entry or accumulation point before major catalysts like the first Neutron launch are realized.
