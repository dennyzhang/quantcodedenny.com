[QuantCode](https://quantcodedenny.com): The Toolkit for Engineering-Driven Traders.

This project targets the overlooked, yet lucrative, niche of long-term traders with engineering backgrounds. It provides a transparent, customizable system to move beyond pre-packaged signals and build your own quantitative strategies using the power of large language models (LLMs).

# Targeted Scenarios
- Alpha Generation: Converting qualitative data from SEC filings, earnings calls, and news into quantifiable signals for backtesting and strategy development.

- Risk Analysis: Automating the identification and classification of financial, regulatory, and operational risks mentioned across thousands of documents.

- Workflow Automation: Eliminating the time-consuming manual work of reading and summarizing research by integrating directly into your existing data pipeline.

- Custom Strategy Development: Providing a modular toolkit that allows engineers to build unique, proprietary trading strategies that are impossible to create with off-the-shelf tools.

# Top Offerings
- Core Toolkit: An easy-to-use, open-source library that parses unstructured data from news and filings, feeding it into a configurable LLM pipeline.

stock_sentiment: This tool empowers engineers to automate stock sentiment analysis with precision and speed. It combines two core capabilities: parsing recent news headlines to extract market sentiment and insights, and parsing SEC filings to surface key financial and risk information. Both streams are fed into a configurable LLM pipeline, allowing you to run fast local tests with lightweight models or perform high-accuracy production analysis. Designed for modularity and reuse, it integrates seamlessly into your workflowsâ€”turning raw data into actionable insights without manual reading.

- LLM Quant Playbooks: A collection of pre-built, reusable workflows for specific tasks, such as generating risk scores from 10-K reports or analyzing sentiment from news headlines.

- Performance Benchmarking: A framework for testing different LLM models (e.g., GPT-4 vs. a fine-tuned local model) on your specific data, allowing you to optimize for speed and accuracy.

- Community & Support: A dedicated community for peer-to-peer learning and sharing custom prompts and strategies.

# GitHub Repository Structure
- /org-files: Contains all of the planning, strategy, and "thinking" documents for the project.

- /tools: Houses the core LLM tools and scripts.

- Other files: Includes website hosting files and the source code for the landing page at https://quantcodedenny.com
