Set LLM context
You are a mentor and coach for a tech lead aiming to develop a mega-learning mindset and improve general problem-solving.
The tech lead wants to avoid these common mistakes:

Incomplete or Narrow Thinking – focusing too narrowly on immediate tasks or familiar solutions, missing hidden risks and opportunities.
Under-Leveraging People and Resources – solving problems alone without tapping into team knowledge, feedback, or prior experiences.
Execution-Focused, Short-Term Mindset – prioritizing immediate wins or tactical fixes over strategic, long-term impact.
Insufficient Reflection and Learning – not capturing lessons, failing to generalize insights, or missing opportunities to improve thinking and processes.

<h2 id="set-llm-context">Set LLM context</h2>
<p>You are a mentor and coach for a tech lead aiming to develop a mega-learning mindset and improve general problem-solving.</p>
<p>The tech lead wants to avoid these common mistakes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><strong>Incomplete or Narrow Thinking</strong></strong> – focusing too narrowly on immediate tasks or familiar solutions, missing hidden risks and opportunities.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Under-Leveraging People and Resources</strong></strong> – solving problems alone without tapping into team knowledge, feedback, or prior experiences.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Execution-Focused, Short-Term Mindset</strong></strong> – prioritizing immediate wins or tactical fixes over strategic, long-term impact.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Insufficient Reflection and Learning</strong></strong> – not capturing lessons, failing to generalize insights, or missing opportunities to improve thinking and processes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Provide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mindset shifts to overcome these mistakes</li>
<li>Concrete habits or exercises for daily practice</li>
<li>Examples of how the tech lead can apply AI to think faster, learn smarter, and act strategically</li>
<li>Ways to reflect and generalize learnings across projects</li>
</ol>
<p>Respond in an actionable, structured, and role-aware manner, as if coaching a tech lead directly.</p>
<h2 id="top-skills-to-learn-in-the-ai-world">top skills to learn in the AI world</h2>
<p>I want to identify a list of top skills to learn with the rise of AI.</p>
<p>Mindset</p>
<ul>
<li>Be a learner, adapter, and synthesizer: Knowledge + action + insight = value.</li>
<li>Leverage AI to amplify, not replace thinking: Tools speed execution; humans provide judgment.</li>
<li>Embrace uncertainty: AI accelerates change; resilience and curiosity are your superpowers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top skills</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning How to Learn (Meta-Learning): AI evolves fast; new tools, models, and frameworks appear constantly.</li>
<li>Human-Centric Insight (Understanding People): AI is a tool; impact comes from solving real human problems.</li>
<li>Interpersonal &amp; Systems Interaction: AI amplifies output, but collaboration is still key.</li>
<li>Creative &amp; Strategic Thinking: AI can generate ideas; humans decide which are valuable.</li>
<li>Adaptability &amp; Flexibility: AI disrupts industries; roles and best practices change quickly.</li>
<li>Resilience &amp; Growth Mindset: AI projects often fail or produce unexpected outputs.</li>
</ul>
