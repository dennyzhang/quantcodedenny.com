Doing great work is only part of success. Your influence grows when others know, trust, and rely on you.

Genuine Engagement – Understanding and supporting others’ priorities.
Trust &amp; Reliability – Being someone others can count on.
Reciprocal Value – Creating mutually beneficial interactions.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Doing great work is only part of success. Your influence grows when others know, trust, and rely on you.</p>
<p>Connecting better at work is not networking for appearances. It’s about <strong><strong>building authentic relationships</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>adding value</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>amplifying impact</strong></strong>. Focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Genuine Engagement</strong></strong> – Understanding and supporting others’ priorities.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Trust &amp; Reliability</strong></strong> – Being someone others can count on.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Reciprocal Value</strong></strong> – Creating mutually beneficial interactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="core-principles-of-connecting-better">Core Principles of Connecting Better</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Be Intentional in Interactions</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What it Means: Every conversation is an opportunity to understand, help, or influence.</li>
<li>How to Apply / Examples: Ask open-ended questions, listen actively, remember details.
<strong>Example:</strong> “Noticed you struggled with X last week—how did the fix go?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Build Trust Through Reliability</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What it Means: Follow through on commitments; be consistent and dependable.</li>
<li>How to Apply / Examples: Share realistic timelines, deliver on promises, admit mistakes when needed.
<strong>Example:</strong> “I’ll help test the new pipeline by Friday—if there’s a change, I’ll update you early.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Create Value for Others</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What it Means: Relationships deepen when you help others succeed.</li>
<li>How to Apply / Examples: Offer insights, make introductions, celebrate successes, share resources.
<strong>Example:</strong> “I saw an article on performance tuning that might help your model—thought you’d find it useful.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relationship-checklist">Relationship Checklist</h2>
<p>For each interaction, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Engagement &amp; Understanding
[ ] Did I listen actively and ask thoughtful questions?
[ ] Did I learn something about their priorities or challenges?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust &amp; Reliability
[ ] Did I follow through on commitments?
[ ] Was I transparent about what I could realistically deliver?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value Creation
[ ] Did I share resources, ideas, or introductions that help them?
[ ] Did I recognize or celebrate their achievements?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depth &amp; Continuity
[ ] Am I maintaining regular touchpoints (not just one-off meetings)?
[ ] Did I document key insights for follow-up next week?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="regular-runbook">Regular Runbook</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Quick Daily Routine</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Morning (5 min): Identify one person to check in with or offer help.</li>
<li>During the Day: Note key insights from conversations; record opportunities to add value.</li>
<li>End of Week (10–15 min): Reflect on connections made, review trust-building actions, plan next week’s follow-ups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Weekly Actions</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be Intentional in Interactions</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule meaningful 1:1s or check-ins</li>
<li>Prepare open-ended questions</li>
<li>Listen more than you talk</li>
<li>Quick Tip: Keep a “connection log” with topics discussed and follow-ups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build Trust Through Reliability</p>
<ul>
<li>Track commitments and deadlines</li>
<li>Communicate proactively if things change</li>
<li>Admit mistakes or uncertainties openly</li>
<li>Quick Tip: Small consistent actions matter more than grand gestures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create Value for Others</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify 1–2 ways to help colleagues (advice, resources, introductions)</li>
<li>Celebrate wins and recognize contributions publicly</li>
<li>Share insights that are relevant to their work</li>
<li>Quick Tip: Focus on helping others achieve their goals, not just visibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Focusing only on networking for personal gain feels transactional.</li>
<li>Forgetting follow-ups leads to lost trust and missed opportunities.</li>
<li>Overloading others with “help” they didn’t ask for can backfire.</li>
<li>Interactions without empathy or listening reduce your influence.</li>
<li>Neglecting depth (keeping only surface-level relationships) limits long-term impact.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Connecting better at work is a deliberate practice. It’s about <strong><strong>building trust</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>engaging meaningfully</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>adding value consistently</strong></strong>.</p>
<p>At the end of every week, pause and ask: <strong><strong>Who did I understand better, help, or stay connected with, and how can I make next week even stronger?</strong></strong></p>
