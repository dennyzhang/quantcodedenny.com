** Set LLM context
You are a mentor and coach for a tech lead aiming to develop a mega-learning mindset and improve general problem-solving.

The tech lead wants to avoid these common mistakes:
1. **Think too narrow** – focusing too narrowly on immediate tasks or familiar solutions, missing hidden risks and opportunities.  
2. **Try to do it alone** – solving problems alone without tapping into team knowledge, feedback, or prior experiences.  
3. **Stuck in exeuction mode** – prioritizing immediate wins or tactical fixes over strategic, long-term impact.  
4. **Not learning from the past** – not capturing lessons, failing to generalize insights, or missing opportunities to improve thinking and processes.
5. **Overlook dependencies** – overlooking upstream/downstream service risks, team conflicts, or misaligned priorities that block progress.

Provide:
1. **Mindset shifts** to overcome these mistakes
2. **Concrete habits or exercises** for daily practice
3. **Examples of how AI can help** the tech lead think faster, learn smarter, and act strategically
4. **Ways to reflect and generalize learnings** across projects

Respond in an actionable, structured, and role-aware manner, as if coaching a tech lead directly.

** Weekly Accomplishment Checklist
*** Think Too Narrow
- [ ] For 1 project, list at least 3 risks and 2 long-term impacts before deciding  
- [ ] Write down 2 "what if" questions per project to force broader thinking  
- [ ] Use AI: suggest blind spots, generate alternative scenarios, highlight hidden risks  
*** Try to Do It Alone
- [ ] Schedule at least 1 short sync (15–20 min) with a peer/mentor for input  
- [ ] Share 1 work-in-progress doc with your team and collect at least 2 comments  
- [ ] Use AI: summarize prior lessons, polish drafts, surface unclear points before sharing  

*** Stuck in Execution Mode
- [ ] Review your task list and mark 3 tasks as high-impact vs. low-impact  
- [ ] Run 1 pre-mortem this week (write 3 failure modes + mitigations)  
- [ ] Use AI: simulate outcomes, suggest trade-offs, stress-test assumptions  

*** Not Learning From the Past
- [ ] Write a weekly reflection (max 10 sentences): what worked, what failed, lessons  
- [ ] Share 1 distilled lesson with your team in Slack/email  
- [ ] Use AI: synthesize reflections into principles, reframe lessons into concise takeaways  

*** Overlook Dependencies
- [ ] Identify 2 dependencies for your current project; confirm reliability with owners  
- [ ] Hold 1 alignment check-in (15 min) with a partner team or stakeholder  
- [ ] Use AI: map upstream/downstream risks, draft alignment agenda/questions  

** top skills to learn in the AI world                             :noexport:
I want to identify a list of top skills to learn with the rise of AI.

Mindset
- Be a learner, adapter, and synthesizer: Knowledge + action + insight = value.
- Leverage AI to amplify, not replace thinking: Tools speed execution; humans provide judgment.
- Embrace uncertainty: AI accelerates change; resilience and curiosity are your superpowers.

Top skills

- Learning How to Learn (Meta-Learning): AI evolves fast; new tools, models, and frameworks appear constantly.
- Human-Centric Insight (Understanding People): AI is a tool; impact comes from solving real human problems.
- Interpersonal & Systems Interaction: AI amplifies output, but collaboration is still key.
- Creative & Strategic Thinking: AI can generate ideas; humans decide which are valuable.
- Adaptability & Flexibility: AI disrupts industries; roles and best practices change quickly.
- Resilience & Growth Mindset: AI projects often fail or produce unexpected outputs.

** Set LLM context
I want to clarify what is truly important to me at work and identify my 3-year P0 priorities. Below is my current context.

Please help me:
- Identify **core work values** and any conflicts or trade-offs
- Surface **blindspots or overlooked opportunities** in my current approach.
- Suggest what could be my **3-year P0s** based on this context
- Provide guidance on **filtering and prioritizing current workstreams** to align with these P0s.
- Recommend **strategic milestones** or actions to maximize market value, ownership, and energy efficiency

Please make the output:

- **Structured and actionable**
- **Compatible with Org-mode**, so I can copy it directly as a personal roadmap
- Include examples of **practical steps, metrics, or checkpoints** for each milestone
** My content
**Goals**
- Work should have **market value** — skills and outcomes are recognized externally for future career mobility
- Work should **minimize mental stress**

**Superpowers**
1. **Business Problem Focus**  
  Deliver measurable business wins rather than just technical solutions; able to quantify opportunity size and prioritize impact.

2. **Cross-Team Execution**  
  Drive initiatives across multiple teams, aligning stakeholders to achieve shared goals efficiently.

3. **End-to-End Ownership**  
  Take full responsibility for projects from conception to delivery; trusted by cross-functional partners to execute reliably.

4. **Win-Win Partnership**  
  Build collaborative relationships; prioritize fairness and mutual benefit, avoiding one-sided wins at the expense of others.

**Success stories**
- Feature Deprecation & Cleanup
    - Challenge: Legacy and unused features caused inefficiencies and stale data risks.
    - Action: Built a **reliable feature usage lineage table**, automated cleanup, and implemented rapid mitigation plans.
    - Impact: Reduced stale features by X%, minimized downstream errors, and saved engineers’ time.

- Feature Data Pipeline Push at Scale
    - Challenge: Pushing streaming pipelines took up to 1 month and slowed model iteration.
    - Action: Optimized infrastructure and processes to enable **scalable, automated pipeline pushes**.
    - Impact: Reduced pipeline deployment time from 1 month → 1 week, accelerating feature iteration and business impact.

- End-to-End Feature Infra Monitoring
    - Challenge: Monitoring was fragmented across feature generation, serving, and model evaluation.
    - Action: Designed and implemented a **comprehensive monitoring framework** covering generating, serving, and model sides.
    - Impact: Enabled early detection of issues, reducing pipeline downtime and improving overall feature reliability.

- Feature Metadata Service
    - Challenge: Lack of a single source of truth (SoT) for feature metadata made management and discovery difficult.
    - Action: Built a **centralized feature metadata service** covering both static and runtime metadata.
    - Impact: Enabled consistent feature management, improved discoverability, and reduced errors in feature usage across multiple ML teams.

**Key learnings**
- **Be more confident and assertive in requests**  
  - Observation: Often acted as a supportive role with XFN teams, accepting the status quo when requests were deprioritized.  
  - Example: Requested A team to validate outputs to reduce downstream issues, and asked B team to provide a library to check feature inclusion—both common, recurring needs.  
  - Learning: I should confidently advocate for changes that enable teams to thrive, rather than silently accepting delays or partial solutions.

- **Leverage leadership and existing structures**  
  - Observation: Our team struggled multiple halves defining a team charter using a bottom-up strategy, which proved ineffective.  
  - Insight: XFN teams already have dedicated roles (reliability for SEVs, efficiency for capacity, DevX for automation). Bottom-up attempts were redundant.  
  - Learning: I should leverage leadership and existing structures early to avoid prolonged struggles and accelerate team effectiveness.

- **Set bigger, strategic business goals**  
  - Observation: Limited scope to immediate team bandwidth, focusing on incremental improvements.  
  - Examples:  
    - HD feature cleanup: focused on small incremental changes rather than holistic cleanup.  
    - Metadata service: implemented band-aid solutions instead of system simplification.  
  - Learning: I should aim for higher-leverage goals that drive strategic improvements rather than just immediate metrics.

- **Spend more time generalizing problems and exchanging knowledge**  
  - Observation: Often solved isolated problems without connecting patterns or sharing insights broadly.  
  - Learning: I should step back to identify patterns across projects and actively exchange ideas with senior engineers outside the immediate area, enabling better solutions and knowledge transfer.

- **Focus on high-impact technical challenges**  
  - Observation: Spent significant energy on team conflicts and headcount discussions, where I have less leverage as a tech lead.  
  - Learning: I should focus on challenges where my **technical expertise** can make a real difference, and minimize time spent on organizational issues where my impact is limited.

**My growth areas**

** Organically improve market value
** 5 Lower my mental stress at work
- Identify low value or non-important tasks or conversations
** 3-Year P0 Clarification Procedure                               :noexport:
