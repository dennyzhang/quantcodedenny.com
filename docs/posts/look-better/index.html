Introduction
Working hard alone isn’t enough. Leaders and decision-makers are busy — if they don’t see your impact, it might as well not exist.
Looking better at work is not self-promotion. It’s about making your real contributions visible, credible, and trusted. Focus on:

Business Value – What tangible impact did your work have?
Complexity &amp; Learning – What challenges did you overcome, and what did you learn?

Core Principles of Looking Better

  
      
          Principle
          What It Means
          How to Apply / Examples
      
  
  
      
          &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
          &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
          &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
      
      
          1. Make Your Impact Visible
          Leaders care about outcomes, not effort.
          Quantify results (dollars, time saved, efficiency), link to KPIs, compare before/after. Example: “Our work avoided $2M in lost revenue during peak traffic.”
      
      
          2. Highlight Complexity &amp; Learning
          Show hidden challenges and what you learned.
          Explain hurdles, new methods, tools, or skills. Example: “Cut model training costs by 30% by debugging fragmented pipelines; built reusable monitoring tools for the org.”
      
      
          3. Leverage Others &amp; Build Credibility
          Feedback from peers is more credible than self-promotion.
          Share updates, recognize others, encourage allies to amplify your impact. Focus on consistent results over time.

          1. Make Your Impact Visible
          - Reframe your latest project in business terms.&lt;br&gt;- Quantify results (dollars, time saved, efficiency).&lt;br&gt;- Connect outcomes to team/company KPIs.
          Share short updates in team forums. Always link work to priorities.
      
      
          2. Highlight Complexity &amp; Learning
          - Note 1–2 hidden challenges or obstacles from your last project.&lt;br&gt;- Capture key learnings or new skills.&lt;br&gt;- Think about what lessons others could reuse.
          Keep a personal log; use examples when sharing in meetings or updates.
      
      
          3. Leverage Others &amp; Build Credibility
          - Identify 1–2 allies who can amplify your work.&lt;br&gt;- Recognize contributions of others.&lt;br&gt;- Encourage peers to share positive feedback.&lt;br&gt;- Consistently deliver results over time.
          Focus on sustained excellence, not one-off polish. Small wins matter.
      
  

Common Pitfalls

Overdoing self-promotion can damage trust.
Not surfacing business value makes your project look like “just execution.”
Not surfacing complexity &amp; learning makes effort undervalued.
Staying invisible leads to missed recognition and opportunities.
Focusing on busyness instead of business impact dilutes your reputation.

Conclusion
Looking better at work is not superficial. It’s about telling the full story of your contributions. Use the techniques to make your business value and complexity &amp; learning clear.">
