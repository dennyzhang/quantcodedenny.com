Embrace imperfection: treat the LLM as a co-pilot, not a guarantee.
Iterate fast: copy errors to the LLM and ask for fixes immediately—speed &gt; perfect understanding.
Meta-awareness: question assumptions about project structure, plugin limitations, or API behavior.
Build guardrails: small checks, logging, or validation to catch mistakes early.
Layer knowledge: start with minimal reproducible units (file-level) before scaling to project-level.
Document gaps: track behaviors, limitations, and “unknown unknowns” to avoid repeating mistakes.
Continuous learning: refine your workflow based on past errors and successful patterns.
Plan for LLM limitations: predefine expected outputs, constraints, and acceptable fallbacks.

Technical challenges

Multiple versions: functions may be undefined or unsupported across versions.
Understanding conventions: e.g., Hugo generates files into the `docs` folder, not `content`.
Lack of defensive coding: errors propagate, making debugging harder.
ox-hugo 0.12.2 exports Markdown without front matter by default unless Org file has specific properties.
LLM behavior: when facing impossible tasks, it often loops endlessly instead of admitting &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
Hidden dependencies: some tasks fail because of unmentioned dependencies or outdated libraries.
Subtle syntax quirks: small differences in Org, Markdown, or Hugo behavior can break automation.

Gaps, blind spots &amp; workflow caveats

Works well for individual files, but not full project structures.
[#A] You don’t know what you don’t know—and the LLM may not tell you.
Component limitations arise from business, capability, or incompatibilities:

Business: e.g., Twitter free API only allows pulling 100 posts/day.
Capability: e.g., Emacs plugin (ox-hugo) only supports Markdown blocks in Org files.
Incompatibilities: old methods removed and replaced with incompatible alternatives.


Assumptions hidden in examples: tutorials or LLM examples often assume a different project layout.
Don’t overanalyze error messages; capture them and ask the LLM to propose fixes.
Recognize impossible tasks early—stop LLM loops.
Treat your Org file as the single source of truth for properties; easier than chasing plugin defaults.
Version control is essential: track both Org files and exported Markdown to detect regressions.
Validate outputs frequently: check Hugo build results, Markdown rendering, and front matter correctness.
Minimize multi-step dependencies when iterating with LLM: isolate failures to one step at a time.
Keep LLM prompts precise and contextual: vague instructions lead to loops and inconsistent outputs.
