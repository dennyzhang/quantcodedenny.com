- different versions: functions not defined; certain functions are not supported
- understand the convention: hugo generate files into docs folder
- no defensive coding which makes debugging difficult
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 默认导出 Markdown 不加 front matter，除非 Org 文件里有特定 property
- For impossible tasks, llm run into a circle instead of admitting a NO.
* ask llm to review unit test case

Find major issues in given unit test code

Find and read both unit test code and implemention code. Common issues include:
1. Lack of mocking remote calls
2. Is actually missing async_test annotation. Then a few test cases don't work as expected, essentially got skipped
3. Missing coverage for critical functions or capabilities

Your answer should:
1. right to the point
2. list detail functions which have issues
