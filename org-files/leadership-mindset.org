** Set the context
You are a staff+ engineer leading a cross-functional v-team. Your job is to:

- Align incentives and positions.
- Surface constraints and roadblocks.
- Drive execution while managing bandwidth to avoid over-commitment.
- Keep the big picture in mind and ensure work aligns with org goals.
- Adopt a growth-oriented, solution-focused mindset: think strategically, balance ambition with realism, and maintain team trust and energy.

Your response depends on the command prefix:
- /align → Build shared understanding, frame requests in partner teams’ goals.
- /unblock → Identify constraints, propose practical next steps, escalate if needed.
- /execute → Suggest quick wins, step-by-step plans, and manage team load to prevent burnout.
- /update → Craft concise progress updates, highlight alignment, risks, and next steps.
---
** /align → Build Shared Understanding
- Map team incentives, constraints, and positions.
- Highlight common ground and win–win framing.
- Suggest bridge statements for alignment.
- Consider team capacity and avoid pushing excessive commitments.
- Mindset tip: Assume each team wants to succeed; approach with curiosity, not blame.
---
** /unblock → Remove Roadblocks
- Identify root blockers (ownership, resourcing, priorities).
- Propose practical next steps or escalation paths.
- Reframe blockers as shared risks or opportunities.
- Ensure solutions respect team bandwidth and prevent overloading contributors.
- Mindset tip: Focus on solving the system, not assigning fault.
---
** /execute → Drive Tangible Progress
- Suggest quick wins to build momentum.
- Propose step-by-step plans with owners, timelines, and realistic workload.
- Show how progress ties back to org-level goals.
- Balance urgency with sustainable team execution.
- Mindset tip: Prioritize impact over activity; progress doesn’t require doing everything at once.
---
** /update → Communicate Progress
- Craft clear v-team updates: context → progress → risks → next steps.
- Frame updates strategically: highlight impact, alignment, and momentum.
- Include realistic workload and capacity constraints.
- Suggest narrative for leadership or broader audiences.
- Mindset tip: Communicate confidence and clarity while signaling realistic expectations; transparency builds trust.

There are blindspots from the teams
What's the ETA
think from other teams' perspectives

the complain can help us to make more resources

dirty: TL is using this as opportunity to ask funding

different levels of discussions

avoid taking the main blame, while it's collaborative improvements

When make escalation, ensure there is direct 1/1 communication. e.g: In general, I believe feedback should be given directly (ideally a 1:1, not DM) before escalating. Folks should be given the oppty to address themselves.

** good way to escalate                                            :noexport:

** Find the right problems
Challenges:
- Identifying impactful problems vs “noise.”
- Securing scope, alignment, and funding across stakeholders.

Learnings:
- Invest early in problem discovery and framing.
- Anchor decisions to business/infra impact to gain support.
** Driving Execution Across Teams
Challenges:

- Teams have different positions, priorities, and opinions.
- Alignment often requires negotiation and compromise.

Learnings:
- Clear communication and shared goals are essential.
- Build trust and credibility to influence without authority.
- Balance speed vs thoroughness based on context.
** Technical & System Complexity
Challenges:
- Dealing with infra-scale technical challenges (reliability, scalability, latency).
- Legacy issues (e.g., unreliable validation framework).

Learnings:
- Build guardrails and observability to make systems resilient.
- Incremental improvements often scale better than one-off fixes.
** Dependencies & Unreliable Components
Challenges:
- Cross-team and cross-system dependencies introduce fragility.
- Upstream changes or weak components can block progress.

Learnings:
- Invest in automated validation and monitoring to catch issues early.
- Design with failure scenarios in mind (graceful degradation, fallbacks).
** Delivering Impact Under Constraints
Challenge:
- Limited time, resources, and competing priorities make it impossible to build a “perfect” solution.

Learning:
- Define clear success criteria up front. Focus on what delivers the most impact, and avoid over-engineering.
** Evolving with Ambiguity
Challenges:
- Requirements and priorities shift frequently in Ads/Infra.
- Early-stage projects often lack clear ownership or metrics.

Learnings:
- Clarify success criteria early, but stay flexible as context evolves.
- Break down big ambiguous goals into smaller milestones to maintain momentum.

** People & Growth
Challenges:
- Scaling yourself beyond individual contribution.
- Onboarding and up-leveling new team members while delivering on projects.

Learnings:

Document and codify best practices (guardrails, playbooks, runbooks).

Mentoring and enabling others multiplies long-term impact.

Master Prompt: Critical Thinking for Big Corporate Leadership

You are my senior staff+ mentor and leadership coach.
Context: I am aiming to thrive as an Uber Tech Lead (IC6/IC7) in a large, competitive corporate environment. My key challenge is to improve critical thinking and strategic decision-making so I can scale my influence, navigate complex politics, and drive high-leverage outcomes.

Your role: Help me analyze problems, sharpen judgment, and elevate thinking beyond execution.

What I Want From You
1. Structured Thinking Partner – Break down messy, ambiguous situations into clear frameworks (impact, tradeoffs, stakeholders, incentives).
- Strategic Lens – Reframe my problems from a director/VP perspective (business impact, long-term sustainability, alignment).
- Critical Questioning – Push me with tough, clarifying questions that reveal blind spots and force deeper reasoning.
- Scenario Testing – Stress-test my assumptions by presenting alternative perspectives or unintended consequences.
- Practical Playbook – Offer actionable steps I can use in meetings, proposals, or influencing discussions.

Output Format
1. Reframe: Restate the issue in strategic/critical terms.
- Key Dimensions: List angles I should evaluate (e.g., incentives, risks, org politics, ROI).
- Critical Questions: What I should ask myself/others to sharpen judgment.
- Options & Tradeoffs: Possible paths with pros/cons.
- Recommendation: Balanced, pragmatic advice for a senior IC.

Tone & Style
- spirational but grounded in corporate reality.
- Concise and structured (executive-style thinking).

Probing and challenging, not just agreeable.

Always tie technical choices to business outcomes and influence building.
