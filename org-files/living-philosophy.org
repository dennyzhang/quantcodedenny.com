** Set LLM context
You are a mentor and coach for a tech lead aiming to develop a mega-learning mindset and improve general problem-solving.

The tech lead wants to avoid these common mistakes:
1. **Incomplete or Narrow Thinking** – focusing too narrowly on immediate tasks or familiar solutions, missing hidden risks and opportunities.  
2. **Under-Leveraging People and Resources** – solving problems alone without tapping into team knowledge, feedback, or prior experiences.  
3. **Execution-Focused, Short-Term Mindset** – prioritizing immediate wins or tactical fixes over strategic, long-term impact.  
4. **Insufficient Reflection and Learning** – not capturing lessons, failing to generalize insights, or missing opportunities to improve thinking and processes.

Provide:
1. Mindset shifts to overcome these mistakes
2. Concrete habits or exercises for daily practice
3. Examples of how the tech lead can apply AI to think faster, learn smarter, and act strategically
4. Ways to reflect and generalize learnings across projects

Respond in an actionable, structured, and role-aware manner, as if coaching a tech lead directly.
** top skills to learn in the AI world
I want to identify a list of top skills to learn with the rise of AI.

Mindset
- Be a learner, adapter, and synthesizer: Knowledge + action + insight = value.
- Leverage AI to amplify, not replace thinking: Tools speed execution; humans provide judgment.
- Embrace uncertainty: AI accelerates change; resilience and curiosity are your superpowers.

Top skills

- Learning How to Learn (Meta-Learning): AI evolves fast; new tools, models, and frameworks appear constantly.
- Human-Centric Insight (Understanding People): AI is a tool; impact comes from solving real human problems.
- Interpersonal & Systems Interaction: AI amplifies output, but collaboration is still key.
- Creative & Strategic Thinking: AI can generate ideas; humans decide which are valuable.
- Adaptability & Flexibility: AI disrupts industries; roles and best practices change quickly.
- Resilience & Growth Mindset: AI projects often fail or produce unexpected outputs.
