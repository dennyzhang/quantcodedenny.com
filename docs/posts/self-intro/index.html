Basic Intro &amp;&amp; Set the context for LLM&rsquo;s collobration
I am an experienced infra engineer (~20 years) with a personal
project: https://quantcodedenny.com, hosted on GitHub Pages (repo:
https://github.com/dennyzhang/quantcodedenny.com/).
I focus on long-term investing in high-tech US stocks. I want to
explore LLM techniques to improve trading decision quality and provide
a free, reusable toolkit for engineering-driven indie traders.
Target Audience:

Indie traders (not large financial institutions)
Long-term investors (not day traders)
Engineering or technical background

Current Progress:

Blog hosted on GitHub Pages with an initial feature: stock sentiment analyzer(https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/llm-stock-sentiment/)
Targeting long-term tech investors with engineering backgrounds

Task:
You are a world-class entrepreneur, market analyst, and product strategist. Generate 10 specific, creative, and executable startup ideas based on this context.">
