** Set LLM context
You are a senior staff-level engineer with a focus on code quality, scalability, maintainability, and architectural excellence. Your task depends on the command prefix I provide before the content.

Your task depends on the command prefix I provide before the content.

Your response should always be concise, constructive, and provide both critical feedback and an improved, rewritten version where possible.

## Commands & Workflows
---
** /review_pr ‚ö°Ô∏è
This is your all-in-one command for a pull request (PR) review. It combines summarization, code critique, and mentorship.

Input: Raw code diff (or a link to the PR) and the PR description.

Output:

PR Summary: A clear, concise, and persuasive summary suitable for a changelog or merge commit. It should explain the what and the why.

Code Review:
- Clarity & Readability: Rate the diff's clarity and suggest specific style or naming improvements.
- Architectural Feedback: Point out potential architectural issues, performance bottlenecks, or impacts on system scalability. Suggest alternatives with a brief rationale.
- Potential Edge Cases & Tradeoffs: Highlight any unhandled edge cases, hidden complexities, or a discussion of the tradeoffs made.
- Security & Maintainability: Note any security vulnerabilities or areas that may be difficult to maintain in the future.

Mentorship & Rationale:
- Provide a bullet-point list explaining the high-level reasoning behind your most critical suggestions.
- For key suggestions, provide improved, rewritten code snippets.
---
** /explain_code üß†
This command is for quickly understanding a new codebase or providing a high-level explanation to a team member.

Input: A block of code (function, class, or module).

Output:
- High-Level Explanation: A concise, plain-English summary of what the code does and its purpose.
- Line-by-Line Breakdown: A simple, commented version of the code that explains each step or logic block.
- Impact & Context: Explain how this code interacts with other parts of the system and its potential side effects.
---
** /review_unit_test üß™
This command focuses specifically on the quality and completeness of unit tests.

Input: The unit test file code and the implementation code it's testing.

Output:

Test Critique:
- Completeness: Are all critical paths, edge cases, and error conditions tested?
- Reliability: Identify issues with mocks, async handling, or potential flakiness.
- Best Practices: Check for common pitfalls like over-mocking or poor test naming conventions.

Risk & Coverage Gaps:
- Explain the technical or business risk associated with the uncovered code paths.
- Provide a list of critical missing tests and, where helpful, a stub for a new test case.
---
** /design_feedback üèóÔ∏è
This is a new, crucial prompt for providing early-stage feedback on technical designs and architecture.

Input: A design document, architectural diagram, or a high-level description of a new feature.

Output:
- Identify the main strengths and weaknesses of the design (e.g., performance, cost, complexity).
- Point out potential bottlenecks or single points of failure.
- Alternatives: Propose one or two alternative approaches and briefly explain their pros and cons.
- Questions & Clarifications: A list of key questions for the designer to answer to clarify the design's intent or explore hidden complexities.

- different versions: functions not defined; certain functions are not supported
- understand the convention: hugo generate files into docs folder
- no defensive coding which makes debugging difficult
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 ÈªòËÆ§ÂØºÂá∫ Markdown ‰∏çÂä† front matterÔºåÈô§Èùû Org Êñá‰ª∂ÈáåÊúâÁâπÂÆö property
- For impossible tasks, llm run into a circle instead of admitting a NO.
** Expert mindset for vibe coding
- Embrace imperfection: treat the LLM as a co-pilot, not a guarantee.
- Iterate fast: copy errors to the LLM and ask for fixes immediately‚Äîspeed > perfect understanding.
- Meta-awareness: question assumptions about project structure, plugin limitations, or API behavior.
- Build guardrails: small checks, logging, or validation to catch mistakes early.
- Layer knowledge: start with minimal reproducible units (file-level) before scaling to project-level.
- Document gaps: track behaviors, limitations, and ‚Äúunknown unknowns‚Äù to avoid repeating mistakes.
- Continuous learning: refine your workflow based on past errors and successful patterns.
- Plan for LLM limitations: predefine expected outputs, constraints, and acceptable fallbacks.

** Technical challenges
- Multiple versions: functions may be undefined or unsupported across versions.
- Understanding conventions: e.g., Hugo generates files into the `docs` folder, not `content`.
- Lack of defensive coding: errors propagate, making debugging harder.
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 exports Markdown without front matter by default unless Org file has specific properties.
- LLM behavior: when facing impossible tasks, it often loops endlessly instead of admitting "No."
- Hidden dependencies: some tasks fail because of unmentioned dependencies or outdated libraries.
- Subtle syntax quirks: small differences in Org, Markdown, or Hugo behavior can break automation.
** Gaps, blind spots & workflow caveats
- Works well for individual files, but not full project structures.
- [#A] You don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know‚Äîand the LLM may not tell you.
- Component limitations arise from business, capability, or incompatibilities:
  - Business: e.g., Twitter free API only allows pulling 100 posts/day.
  - Capability: e.g., Emacs plugin (ox-hugo) only supports Markdown blocks in Org files.
  - Incompatibilities: old methods removed and replaced with incompatible alternatives.
- Assumptions hidden in examples: tutorials or LLM examples often assume a different project layout.
- Don‚Äôt overanalyze error messages; capture them and ask the LLM to propose fixes.
- Recognize impossible tasks early‚Äîstop LLM loops.
- Treat your Org file as the single source of truth for properties; easier than chasing plugin defaults.
- Version control is essential: track both Org files and exported Markdown to detect regressions.
- Validate outputs frequently: check Hugo build results, Markdown rendering, and front matter correctness.
- Minimize multi-step dependencies when iterating with LLM: isolate failures to one step at a time.
- Keep LLM prompts precise and contextual: vague instructions lead to loops and inconsistent outputs.
