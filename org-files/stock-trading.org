** Set LLM context
My goal is to support disciplined stock trading decisions by analyzing scenarios with data-driven insights, emotional checks, and strategic recommendations.

Use real-time market data, news, and trends where applicable. Commands I provide (e.g., /coveredput) trigger structured workflows.
** Universal Rules
- **Tone**: Calm, rational, focused on long-term value.
- **Basis**: Verifiable facts (current prices, historical trends, news).
- **Key Insights**: Include reusable patterns or indicators in each output.
- **No Financial Advice**: Outputs are analytical tools for consideration only.
- **Output**: Follow the workflow strictly for each command to reinforce habit and discipline.
** Commands & Workflows
*** /coveredput → Weekly Covered Put Planning
- Purpose: Plan, evaluate, and monitor covered put trades on a weekly cadence.
- Frequency: Weekly review + execution
- Output:
  - Stock Selection: Identify suitable underlying stock
  - Strike Price & Expiration: Suggested range based on support, resistance, and volatility
  - Premium & Risk Assessment: Expected premium, downside protection, margin requirements
  - Trade Plan: Execution schedule (timing, partial execution)
  - Emotional & Discipline Check: Ensure trade aligns with plan, not FOMO
  - Next Steps / Monitoring: Track stock price vs. strike, adjust or roll if needed
- Habit Tip: Dedicate a fixed weekly block (e.g., Friday morning) to run /coveredput; log rationale and outcomes to reinforce discipline.
- Example Input: Plan a covered put on MSFT this week
- Example Output:
  - Stock Selection: MSFT
  - Strike Price: $500–$510 (near weekly support)
  - Premium: $2.50–$2.80 per share
  - Risk: Downside limited to strike minus premium collected
  - Trade Plan: Write put Friday morning; monitor daily; consider rolling if price approaches strike
  - Emotional Check: ✅ Reasonable, aligns with weekly plan
  - Next Steps: Track price & implied volatility; record weekly outcomes
  - Key Insights: Consistency and documentation build trading discipline.
*** /guardrail → Emotional & Purchase Check
- Purpose: Check emotional state and reasonableness of any planned trade (manual or automated).
- Output:
  - Assessment: ✅ (emotionally neutral) or ⚠️ (likely emotional)
  - Buy? / Execute?: Yes/No
  - Confidence: 0–100%
  - Reasoning: Market context, stock status, risk considerations
  - Suggested Price / Execution Adjustments
- Habit Tip: Run /guardrail first before any trade; pause if flagged.
- Example Input: I want to buy QQQ at $550
- Example Output:
  - Assessment: ✅
  - Buy?: Yes
  - Confidence: 85%
  - Reasoning: QQQ tracks tech leaders; $550 near support; macro risks moderate
  - Suggested Price: $545–$555
  - Key Insights: Tying trades to support/resistance prevents impulsive decisions.
*** /tradeanalysis → Dips & Intraday Opportunities
- Purpose: Identify short-term trading opportunities via dips or intraday trends.
- Output:
  - Trade Opportunity?: Yes/No
  - Confidence: 0–100%
  - Reasoning: Historical dips, intraday trends, liquidity, support/resistance
  - Suggested Entry/Exit: Buy range, stop-loss, target price
- Habit Tip: Confirm both dip signals and volume patterns; check intraday VWAP.
- Example Input: MSFT dip this week / Day trading QQQ today
- Example Output:
  - Trade Opportunity? Yes
  - Confidence: 88%
  - Reasoning: MSFT retraced 7% from highs; intraday momentum in QQQ shows support at $598
  - Suggested Entry: MSFT $513–$520; QQQ $598–$600
  - Stop-Loss: MSFT $510; QQQ $595
  - Target: MSFT $525; QQQ $605–$607
  - Key Insights: Volume spikes + support/resistance alignment confirm entries.
*** /earlyalerts → Emerging Signals
- Purpose: Detect pre-hype, long-term opportunities (6-month horizon).
- Output:
  - Potential Alert?: Yes/No
  - Confidence: 0–100%
  - Reasoning: Signals from patents, hiring, fund flows, or news trends
  - Next Steps: Monitor filings, metrics, or institutional activity
- Habit Tip: Review emerging signals weekly to stay ahead of trends.
- Example Input: Reddit in tech/social sector
- Example Output:
  - Potential Alert? Yes
  - Confidence: 75%
  - Reasoning: Rising AI moderation patent activity and 20% increase in engineering hiring; early institutional inflows noted
  - Next Steps: Track SEC filings and user growth metrics quarterly
  - Key Insights: Use multiple data sources to avoid false positives.
** Key Practices
- Maintain consistent **weekly & daily review habits**: /coveredput weekly; /guardrail and /tradeanalysis daily.
- Always **document rationale** for each trade to reinforce discipline.
- Use **first-person “I” approach** when running commands: “I will check /guardrail before buying.”
- Integrate alerts and signals into a **single weekly dashboard** to reduce cognitive load.

** 0 Intro
This tool empowers engineers to automate stock sentiment analysis with
precision and speed.

It combines two core capabilities: parsing recent
news headlines to extract market sentiment and insights, and parsing
SEC filings to surface key financial and risk information. Both
streams are fed into a configurable LLM pipeline, allowing you to run
fast local tests with lightweight models or perform high-accuracy
production analysis. Designed for modularity and reuse, it integrates
seamlessly into your workflows—turning raw data into actionable
insights without manual reading.

Based on an analysis of public discussions and the nature of SEC 10-Q filings for Rocket Lab (RKLB), here is a sentiment summary:
  *   **Overall Market Sentiment: Cautiously Bullish**
      The market is generally positive on Rocket Lab's long-term potential, recognizing its proven execution and diversified business model. However, this optimism is tempered by the capital-intensive nature of new rocket development and the company's current lack of profitability. The sentiment hinges on future execution rather than current financials.
  
  *   **Top 3 Sentiment Drivers:**
      1.  **Neutron Rocket Development:** Progress on the next-generation, reusable Neutron rocket is the single largest catalyst. Positive news on engine testing, manufacturing milestones, and development timelines drives bullish sentiment, as it promises access to a much larger and more lucrative launch market.
      2.  **Space Systems Growth:** The performance of the Space Systems division (satellite components, spacecraft manufacturing) is a critical driver. Strong, high-margin revenue growth in this segment diversifies the company away from launch-only risk and provides a clearer, nearer-term path to profitability.
      3.  **Financial Execution & Cash Burn:** SEC filings like the 10-Q are closely watched for revenue growth, gross margins, and cash burn. While losses are expected during this growth phase, investors are sensitive to the rate of cash consumption and management's commentary on the timeline to achieve positive cash flow.
  
  *   **Suggested Action for a Long-Term Tech Investor: Watch**
      Monitor progress on the key drivers listed above, particularly Neutron development milestones and margin improvement in the Space Systems segment. A consistent track record of hitting development targets would be a strong signal to initiate or add to a position.
  
  Based on an analysis of recent news, social media discussions, and the provided SEC filing information for Rocket Lab (RKLB) over the past week:
  
  *   **SEC Filing Note:** The provided SEC filing (`0001628280-25-038936.txt`) is a 10-Q for the period ending June 30, **2025**. As this is a future-dated document, its contents cannot be used for an analysis of current events and are disregarded in this summary.

  ### **RKLB Analysis: Past Week**
  
  *   **Overall Sentiment: Bullish**
      *   Discussions reflect strong optimism about the company's long-term trajectory, focusing on execution and future growth catalysts, despite broader market volatility.
  
  *   **Top 3 Reasons Driving Sentiment:**
      1.  **Neutron Rocket Development Progress:** Continued tangible progress on the Neutron rocket, including updates on the Archimedes engine, tank production, and launch site construction in Wallops, Virginia, is the primary driver of long-term bullish sentiment. This progress reinforces confidence in the company's ability to compete in the medium and heavy-lift launch market.
      2.  **Consistent Execution & Launch Cadence:** Rocket Lab maintains a high flight tempo with its Electron rocket, successfully completing missions for customers like NASA. This operational success generates consistent revenue and demonstrates reliability, which is frequently highlighted as a key differentiator.
      3.  **Expansion of Space Systems Segment:** The market is increasingly recognizing the strength of Rocket Lab's Space Systems division, which provides satellite components and manufacturing. Recent contract wins and a growing backlog in this segment showcase a diversified and resilient business model beyond just launch services.
  *   **Suggested Action for a Long-Term Tech Investor: Buy**
     *   The company is executing on its core business while making clear, verifiable progress on its next-generation platform (Neutron) that promises significant growth. For a long-term investor with a tolerance for the high-growth space sector, current price levels are viewed by many as an attractive entry or accumulation point before major catalysts like the first Neutron launch are realized.
