🌟 Vision
Live a healthy, confident, and wealthy life — balanced across family, personal growth, and financial freedom.
Focus on high-leverage actions, eliminate noise, and consistently reinforce priorities that scale impact.
🎯 Key Objectives (FCM)
1. Family — Build a Healthy and Happy Family

Stay emotionally connected with kids and spouse
Maintain physical health and manage stress effectively

Quarterly Focus

 1:1 time with each kid at least once per week
 Monthly date night with spouse
 Exercise 3x per week, sleep 7h/night

2. Confidence — Strengthen Personal and Professional Growth

Increase professional market value
Improve appearance and communication skills
Build meaningful, positive connections

Quarterly Focus

 Publish or present 1 idea publicly (talk, post, doc)
 Update wardrobe / grooming once per quarter
 Reach out to 1 mentor or peer connection monthly

3. Money — Grow Wealth with Leverage

Earn through smart, sustainable investing
Focus energy on high-return opportunities

Quarterly Focus

 Review investment portfolio quarterly
 Evaluate investment decisions and lessons learned — track what worked, what didn’t
 Automate saving and investing routines
 Delegate or outsource low-value chores

⚙️ Guiding Principles
1. Prioritize What Truly Matters

Be clear on what to do — and what not to do
Bias toward solving problems, not perfection

2. Evolve Mindset Continuously  (E6 → E7 Upgrade)

Think in systems and first principles — solve root causes, not symptoms
Apply growth mindset — treat mistakes as learning opportunities and embrace ambiguity
Create leverage — empower others, clarify processes, and automate repeat work
Lead through influence — align people and decisions without authority

3. Spend Smartly to Earn More

Buy time and energy via good services
Avoid over-optimizing trivial details

🧠 Habits
Good Habits

Share meaningful stories and lessons at work
Say no to small or low-impact optimizations


 Write a weekly summary to reflect and refocus
