- different versions: functions not defined; certain functions are not supported
- understand the convention: hugo generate files into docs folder
- no defensive coding which makes debugging difficult
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 默认导出 Markdown 不加 front matter，除非 Org 文件里有特定 property
- For impossible tasks, llm run into a circle instead of admitting a NO.
** Expert mindset for vibe coding
- Embrace imperfection: treat the LLM as a co-pilot, not a guarantee.
- Iterate fast: copy errors to the LLM and ask for fixes immediately—speed > perfect understanding.
- Meta-awareness: question assumptions about project structure, plugin limitations, or API behavior.
- Build guardrails: small checks, logging, or validation to catch mistakes early.
- Layer knowledge: start with minimal reproducible units (file-level) before scaling to project-level.
- Document gaps: track behaviors, limitations, and “unknown unknowns” to avoid repeating mistakes.
- Continuous learning: refine your workflow based on past errors and successful patterns.
- Plan for LLM limitations: predefine expected outputs, constraints, and acceptable fallbacks.

*** Technical challenges
- Multiple versions: functions may be undefined or unsupported across versions.
- Understanding conventions: e.g., Hugo generates files into the `docs` folder, not `content`.
- Lack of defensive coding: errors propagate, making debugging harder.
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 exports Markdown without front matter by default unless Org file has specific properties.
- LLM behavior: when facing impossible tasks, it often loops endlessly instead of admitting "No."
- Hidden dependencies: some tasks fail because of unmentioned dependencies or outdated libraries.
- Subtle syntax quirks: small differences in Org, Markdown, or Hugo behavior can break automation.
** Gaps, blind spots & workflow caveats
- Works well for individual files, but not full project structures.
- [#A] You don’t know what you don’t know—and the LLM may not tell you.
- Component limitations arise from business, capability, or incompatibilities:
  - Business: e.g., Twitter free API only allows pulling 100 posts/day.
  - Capability: e.g., Emacs plugin (ox-hugo) only supports Markdown blocks in Org files.
  - Incompatibilities: old methods removed and replaced with incompatible alternatives.
- Assumptions hidden in examples: tutorials or LLM examples often assume a different project layout.
- Don’t overanalyze error messages; capture them and ask the LLM to propose fixes.
- Recognize impossible tasks early—stop LLM loops.
- Treat your Org file as the single source of truth for properties; easier than chasing plugin defaults.
- Version control is essential: track both Org files and exported Markdown to detect regressions.
- Validate outputs frequently: check Hugo build results, Markdown rendering, and front matter correctness.
- Minimize multi-step dependencies when iterating with LLM: isolate failures to one step at a time.
- Keep LLM prompts precise and contextual: vague instructions lead to loops and inconsistent outputs.
** edge scenarios where common practice doesn't work well
** llm won't reject requirement which shouldn't happen in the first place

** Major Mistakes That Kill Energy

Skipping Rest and Sleep

Thinking “I’ll sleep later” or underestimating sleep needs.

Leads to poor focus, irritability, and lower productivity.

Poor Nutrition Habits

Relying on caffeine, sugar, or fast food for quick energy.

Irregular meals causing energy crashes.

Sitting Too Long / No Movement

Lack of physical activity reduces blood flow, slows metabolism.

Causes fatigue, back pain, and brain fog.

Multitasking Excessively

Constantly switching tasks drains mental energy.

Leads to stress and low cognitive efficiency.

Ignoring Mental Health

Bottling stress, anxiety, or frustration.

Chronic stress significantly depletes energy.

Overcommitting

Saying yes to everything.

Spreads energy too thin, reduces focus and effectiveness.

Not Managing Environment

Working in cluttered, noisy, or poorly lit spaces.

Lowers alertness and motivation.
** Good Practices to Boost Energy

Optimize Sleep

Aim for 7–9 hours consistently.

Short naps (15–20 mins) can recharge without grogginess.

Balanced Nutrition

Eat protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats.

Stay hydrated — dehydration reduces alertness.

Avoid too much sugar/caffeine; they spike and crash energy.

Movement & Exercise

Short walks, stretches, or standing desks.

Regular exercise improves stamina and mood.

Manage Workload

Prioritize tasks using a clear system (Eisenhower Matrix or MITs — Most Important Tasks).

Batch similar tasks to reduce context switching.

Take Microbreaks

5–10 min break every 60–90 mins.

Step away from the screen, do breathing or stretching.

Mindset & Mental Energy

Practice mindfulness, meditation, or journaling.

Reflect on wins to boost motivation.

Environment Optimization

Light, temperature, and workspace organization affect energy.

Consider natural light, standing options, or noise control.

Smart Caffeine Use

Use caffeine strategically (morning or early afternoon).

Avoid relying on it as your only energy source.

Energy Rituals

Morning routines: light, movement, or journaling.

Midday rituals: short walks, social interaction, or power snack.

* Work Challenges & Key Learnings                                  :noexport:
** Find the right problems
Challenges:
- Identifying impactful problems vs “noise.”
- Securing scope, alignment, and funding across stakeholders.

Learnings:
- Invest early in problem discovery and framing.
- Anchor decisions to business/infra impact to gain support.
** Driving Execution Across Teams
Challenges:

- Teams have different positions, priorities, and opinions.
- Alignment often requires negotiation and compromise.

Learnings:
- Clear communication and shared goals are essential.
- Build trust and credibility to influence without authority.
- Balance speed vs thoroughness based on context.
** Technical & System Complexity
Challenges:
- Dealing with infra-scale technical challenges (reliability, scalability, latency).
- Legacy issues (e.g., unreliable validation framework).

Learnings:
- Build guardrails and observability to make systems resilient.
- Incremental improvements often scale better than one-off fixes.
** Dependencies & Unreliable Components
Challenges:
- Cross-team and cross-system dependencies introduce fragility.
- Upstream changes or weak components can block progress.

Learnings:
- Invest in automated validation and monitoring to catch issues early.
- Design with failure scenarios in mind (graceful degradation, fallbacks).
** Delivering Impact Under Constraints
Challenge:
- Limited time, resources, and competing priorities make it impossible to build a “perfect” solution.

Learning:
- Define clear success criteria up front. Focus on what delivers the most impact, and avoid over-engineering.
** Evolving with Ambiguity
Challenges:
- Requirements and priorities shift frequently in Ads/Infra.
- Early-stage projects often lack clear ownership or metrics.

Learnings:
- Clarify success criteria early, but stay flexible as context evolves.
- Break down big ambiguous goals into smaller milestones to maintain momentum.
** People & Growth
Challenges:
