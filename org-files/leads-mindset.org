* Focus & Prioritization                                           :noexport:
Invest energy in critical, high-leverage work over urgent-but-low-value tasks.

Avoid over-investing in less critical issues.

Seek global optimization over local wins, aligning with higher ROI challenges.
* Communication & Discussions                                      :noexport:
Avoid leaving open-ended threads; drive toward clarity and closure.

Ask framing questions that help the whole team think more broadly.

Ensure comments add unique value after deep thought (avoid noise or obvious remarks).

Encourage meaningful discussions, especially on core problems; don’t prematurely shut them down.

Use simple, concrete language and data to open up topics that engage others.

Deliver hard messages when necessary with clarity and respect.
* Strategic Thinking                                               :noexport:
Think and discuss at a director-level perspective.

Navigate and balance conflicting goals effectively.

Aim for sustainable solutions rather than quick fixes.

Recognize and address blind spots in plans or strategies.

Frame problems with incentives and “why it matters” to gain alignment.
* Leverage & Empowerment                                           :noexport:
Contribute unique value instead of competing on the same ground as others.

Mobilize the team to increase overall output, not just personal output.

Gain useful insights by actively engaging with cross-functional partners and your team.

Add value without doing all the work yourself (e.g., ask clarifying questions, provide direction).

Avoid over-delegation that leaves team members unsupported and projects at risk.

Remove collaboration friction by being flexible on approaches and emphasizing business outcomes.
* Influence & Leadership Presence                                  :noexport:
Grow your influence and power through consistent, value-adding contributions.

Build confidence in the team when facing uncertainty.

Engage actively in discussions to show leadership presence.

Talk with a business sense—connect technical choices to business impact.

Maintain a bias for action to drive progress.

Ensure steady progress forward; momentum builds credibility.
* casual talk                                                      :noexport:
Can I ask that you find a time next week for us

I’m not a big fan of them coming in and claiming that XXX solution should be generalized and pushing for long-term ownership, especially since my understanding was that another group was instrumental in contributing to that solution. That’s why I stepped in to reference the earlier discussions.
