I want to clarify what is truly important to me at work and identify my 3-year P0s. Here’s my context:


Current Role and Experience

Role: Tech Lead in ML Infra
Past growth:

Focused on business problems: delivered measurable business wins, quantified opportunity sizes
Execution across multiple teams: aligned stakeholders to drive common goals
End-to-end ownership: trusted by cross-functional partners
Partnership: prefer fair, win-win collaborations

<p><strong><strong>Preferences / Values</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work should have <strong><strong>market value</strong></strong> — skills and outcomes are recognized externally for future career mobility</li>

<ul>
<li>Main pain points:
<ol>

<li>Recommend <strong><strong>strategic milestones</strong></strong> or actions to maximize market value, ownership, and energy efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>Make the output structured, actionable, and suitable for use in <strong><strong>Org-mode or as a personal roadmap</strong></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="my-goals">My Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Work should have <strong><strong>market value</strong></strong> — skills and outcomes are recognized externally for future career mobility</li>
<li>Work should <strong><strong>minimize mental stress</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-superpowers">My Superpowers</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Business Problem Focus</strong></strong>
Deliver measurable business wins rather than just technical solutions; able to quantify opportunity size and prioritize impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Cross-Team Execution</strong></strong>
Drive initiatives across multiple teams, aligning stakeholders to achieve shared goals efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>End-to-End Ownership</strong></strong>
Take full responsibility for projects from conception to delivery; trusted by cross-functional partners to execute reliably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Win-Win Partnership</strong></strong>
Build collaborative relationships; prioritize fairness and mutual benefit, avoiding one-sided wins at the expense of others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="my-success-stories">My success stories</h2>
<p><strong><strong>Context</strong></strong>: Driving scalable, reliable, and measurable feature infrastructure across feature gneratinon and model serving.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Summary / Marketable Takeaways</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delivered <strong><strong>end-to-end ownership</strong></strong> of high-leverage ML infra projects with measurable results.</li>
<li>Demonstrated ability to <strong><strong>design scalable systems, automate workflows, and improve reliability</strong></strong>.</li>
<li>Built infrastructure that <strong><strong>reduces manual work, improves model performance, and accelerates feature delivery</strong></strong>.</li>
<li>Showcases <strong><strong>transferable skills</strong></strong>: ML infra design, feature management, automation, reliability engineering, and cross-team execution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>Key Projects &amp; Achievements</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Feature Deprecation &amp; Cleanup</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: Legacy and unused features caused inefficiencies and stale data risks.</li>
<li>Action: Built a <strong><strong>reliable feature usage lineage table</strong></strong>, automated cleanup, and implemented rapid mitigation plans.</li>
<li>Impact: Reduced stale features by X%, minimized downstream errors, and saved engineers’ time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature Data Pipeline Push at Scale</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: Pushing streaming pipelines took up to 1 month and slowed model iteration.</li>
<li>Action: Optimized infrastructure and processes to enable <strong><strong>scalable, automated pipeline pushes</strong></strong>.</li>
<li>Impact: Reduced pipeline deployment time from 1 month → 1 week, accelerating feature iteration and business impact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>End-to-End Feature Infra Monitoring</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: Monitoring was fragmented across feature generation, serving, and model evaluation.</li>
<li>Action: Designed and implemented a <strong><strong>comprehensive monitoring framework</strong></strong> covering generating, serving, and model sides.</li>
<li>Impact: Enabled early detection of issues, reducing pipeline downtime and improving overall feature reliability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature Metadata Service</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: Lack of a single source of truth (SoT) for feature metadata made management and discovery difficult.</li>
<li>Action: Built a <strong><strong>centralized feature metadata service</strong></strong> covering both static and runtime metadata.</li>
<li>Impact: Enabled consistent feature management, improved discoverability, and reduced errors in feature usage across multiple ML teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-learnings">Key learnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Be more confident and assertive in requests</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Often acted as a supportive role with XFN teams, accepting the status quo when requests were deprioritized.</li>
<li>Example: Requested A team to validate outputs to reduce downstream issues, and asked B team to provide a library to check feature inclusion—both common, recurring needs.</li>
<li>Learning: I should confidently advocate for changes that enable teams to thrive, rather than silently accepting delays or partial solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Leverage leadership and existing structures</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Our team struggled multiple halves defining a team charter using a bottom-up strategy, which proved ineffective.</li>
<li>Insight: XFN teams already have dedicated roles (reliability for SEVs, efficiency for capacity, DevX for automation). Bottom-up attempts were redundant.</li>
<li>Learning: I should leverage leadership and existing structures early to avoid prolonged struggles and accelerate team effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Set bigger, strategic business goals</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Limited scope to immediate team bandwidth, focusing on incremental improvements.</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>HD feature cleanup: focused on small incremental changes rather than holistic cleanup.</li>
<li>Metadata service: implemented band-aid solutions instead of system simplification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning: I should aim for higher-leverage goals that drive strategic improvements rather than just immediate metrics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Spend more time generalizing problems and exchanging knowledge</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Often solved isolated problems without connecting patterns or sharing insights broadly.</li>
<li>Learning: I should step back to identify patterns across projects and actively exchange ideas with senior engineers outside the immediate area, enabling better solutions and knowledge transfer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Focus on high-impact technical challenges</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Spent significant energy on team conflicts and headcount discussions, where I have less leverage as a tech lead.</li>
<li>Learning: I should focus on challenges where my <strong><strong>technical expertise</strong></strong> can make a real difference, and minimize time spent on organizational issues where my impact is limited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
