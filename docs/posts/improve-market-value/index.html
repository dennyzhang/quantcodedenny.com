Working deeply in ML Infra (like Meta or Google) can make your skills feel too specialized. You solve critical problems — but the broader market may not see your full capability.
The key is to grow visibility and generalize impact organically, through habits you already do daily.
Core Principles

Think End-to-End → Connect your work to business goals, reliability, and system health.
Focus on Non-Urgent Impact → Block time weekly to fix recurring pain or document key learnings.
Translate to Market Value → Frame results in measurable terms (revenue, cost, scale, reliability).
Learn and Share → Write short notes or posts to spread knowledge and show thought leadership.

Regular Routine
Weekly Habits

 Learn broadly → Attend 1 SEV or design review; observe recurring problems and system tradeoffs.
 Connect cross-functionally → Chat with 1 XFN lead to understand context and dependencies.
 Reflect &amp; share → Write 1–3 bullet summary of key learning; note patterns, scripts, or principles.

Monthly Habits

 Host &amp; lead → Run 1 design or postmortem discussion; practice influence, articulation, and framing decisions.
 Mentor → Coach 1–2 engineers; amplify impact and demonstrate multiplier behavior.

Quarterly Habits

 Ship a measurable improvement → Deliver 1 end-to-end enhancement; design for scale, reliability, and visibility.
 Summarize impact → Convert results into metrics or story for internal/external visibility.

Focus Blocks &amp; Best Practices

Protect 1–2 hours weekly for important but non-urgent work: blindspot review, systemic improvements, or skill expansion.
Frame all incidents/projects with business impact: root cause, mitigation, downstream effect, prevented loss or restored capacity.
Ask system-level questions before implementation: downstream effects, hidden dependencies, assumptions, failure modes.
Document &amp; share patterns weekly: recurring issues, scripts, or solutions that others can reuse.
Use external framing: translate internal improvements into transferable, marketable impact.

Watch Out For

Local optimizations without system or business context.
Not documenting key decisions.
Avoiding cross-team or ambiguous problems.
Over-relying on internal tech; always extract general principles.
