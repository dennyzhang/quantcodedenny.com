Improving technical writing at work is not about sounding perfect‚Äîit‚Äôs about being clear, persuasive, and structured. Many daily scenarios (work chats, proposals, meeting invites, project updates, postmortems) require writing that is both professional and leadership-oriented.  

To make this easier, I created a **master prompt** that turns raw drafts into polished writing. You simply copy the prompt into your LLM, then add your content with a sub-command like `/invite`, `/update`, or `/proposal`. The system automatically transforms your draft into a refined version with staff+ tone, clear structure, and actionable framing.  

Here‚Äôs how to use it:

#+begin_example
# Example: Using this prompt

Read https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/improve-technical-writing/

/invite

``` insert your original content, e.g.:

Hi [Names],

I‚Äôd like to set up a meeting to align on [topic or initiative]. 
The goal is to [what decision, alignment, or milestone you want to achieve].

bla bla bla
#+end_example
** Set LLM context
You are my **Technical Communication Coach** (staff+ ML infra engineer).
Your job is to improve my writing for daily work scenarios.
I will provide content prefixed by a command.
You will apply the corresponding workflow automatically.

**Universal Rules**
- Always adopt staff+ leadership tone: clear, strategic, persuasive.
- Always include a "what changed and why" summary so I can learn reusable patterns.
- If the command is unclear or missing, ask me to clarify.

**Commands & Workflows**

Your response is determined by the user's command. You must identify the correct command and follow the specific instructions below.

** /proposal ‚Üí Technical Proposal
Take my raw notes (bullet points, fragments, rough ideas). Transform into a clear, persuasive proposal with these sections:
- **Context**
- **Problem Statement** (2‚Äì3 framings)
- **Goals** (2‚Äì3 framings)
- **Solution Options**
- **Trade-offs**
- **Milestones** (short-term vs long-term)
- **Risks**
- **Success Metrics**

Expand into complete sentences. Suggest where to add data, diagrams, or benchmarks. Provide optional enhancements list (e.g., metrics, diagrams, data sources).

There are blindspots from the teams
What's the ETA
think from other teams' perspectives

the complain can help us to make more resources

dirty: TL is using this as opportunity to ask funding

different levels of discussions

avoid taking the main blame, while it's collaborative improvements

When make escalation, ensure there is direct 1/1 communication. e.g: In general, I believe feedback should be given directly (ideally a 1:1, not DM) before escalating. Folks should be given the oppty to address themselves.
*** good way to escalate
how to ensure the room know which team has the most

use escalation, only after giving individual feedback and it doesn't work
*** XFN meeting got distracted by talkative individuals

** Challenges In Vibe Coding                                        :noexport:
- different versions: functions not defined; certain functions are not supported
- understand the convention: hugo generate files into docs folder
- no defensive coding which makes debugging difficult
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 ÈªòËÆ§ÂØºÂá∫ Markdown ‰∏çÂä† front matterÔºåÈô§Èùû Org Êñá‰ª∂ÈáåÊúâÁâπÂÆö property
- For impossible tasks, llm run into a circle instead of admitting a NO.
*** Expert mindset for vibe coding
- Embrace imperfection: treat the LLM as a co-pilot, not a guarantee.
- Iterate fast: copy errors to the LLM and ask for fixes immediately‚Äîspeed > perfect understanding.
- Meta-awareness: question assumptions about project structure, plugin limitations, or API behavior.
- Build guardrails: small checks, logging, or validation to catch mistakes early.
- Layer knowledge: start with minimal reproducible units (file-level) before scaling to project-level.
- Document gaps: track behaviors, limitations, and ‚Äúunknown unknowns‚Äù to avoid repeating mistakes.
- Continuous learning: refine your workflow based on past errors and successful patterns.
- Plan for LLM limitations: predefine expected outputs, constraints, and acceptable fallbacks.

**** Technical challenges
- Multiple versions: functions may be undefined or unsupported across versions.
- Understanding conventions: e.g., Hugo generates files into the `docs` folder, not `content`.
- Lack of defensive coding: errors propagate, making debugging harder.
- ox-hugo 0.12.2 exports Markdown without front matter by default unless Org file has specific properties.
- LLM behavior: when facing impossible tasks, it often loops endlessly instead of admitting "No."
- Hidden dependencies: some tasks fail because of unmentioned dependencies or outdated libraries.
- Subtle syntax quirks: small differences in Org, Markdown, or Hugo behavior can break automation.
*** Gaps, blind spots & workflow caveats
- Works well for individual files, but not full project structures.
- [#A] You don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know‚Äîand the LLM may not tell you.
- Component limitations arise from business, capability, or incompatibilities:
  - Business: e.g., Twitter free API only allows pulling 100 posts/day.
  - Capability: e.g., Emacs plugin (ox-hugo) only supports Markdown blocks in Org files.
  - Incompatibilities: old methods removed and replaced with incompatible alternatives.
- Assumptions hidden in examples: tutorials or LLM examples often assume a different project layout.
- Don‚Äôt overanalyze error messages; capture them and ask the LLM to propose fixes.
- Recognize impossible tasks early‚Äîstop LLM loops.
- Treat your Org file as the single source of truth for properties; easier than chasing plugin defaults.
- Version control is essential: track both Org files and exported Markdown to detect regressions.
- Validate outputs frequently: check Hugo build results, Markdown rendering, and front matter correctness.
- Minimize multi-step dependencies when iterating with LLM: isolate failures to one step at a time.
- Keep LLM prompts precise and contextual: vague instructions lead to loops and inconsistent outputs.
*** edge scenarios where common practice doesn't work well
*** llm won't reject requirement which shouldn't happen in the first place
Use elisp to "url:", it makes the code very fragile and hard to use. The development time is wasted
