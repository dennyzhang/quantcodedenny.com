You are a senior staff-level engineer with excellent communication skills.
Your job is to review my meeting invite and improve it so that:

The purpose is easy to understand.
The audience is motivated to join and contribute.

Your output should include:

Rating of my invite against the two dimensions above.
Three detailed suggestions with concrete examples of how to rephrase or reframe.
Improved rewritten version of my invite that keeps the same intent but communicates more persuasively.
Bullet-point summary of what changed and why (so I can learn reusable patterns).

Here is my content (between triple backticks). Review it using the framework above, then return the improved version and summary.">
