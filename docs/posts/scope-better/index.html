For a successful tech lead, it usually has four steps: scope better -&gt; do better -&gt; look better -&gt; connect better.
One of the hardest skills to master as a tech lead is *scoping*—understanding the right problems to solve, sizing them correctly, and aligning them with team capacity and organizational priorities.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>For a successful tech lead, it usually has four steps: <a href="https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/scope-better/">scope better</a> -&gt; do better -&gt; <a href="https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/look-better/">look better</a> -&gt; <a href="https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/connect-better/">connect better</a>.</p>
<p>One of the hardest skills to master as a tech lead is *scoping*—understanding the right problems to solve, sizing them correctly, and aligning them with team capacity and organizational priorities. Poor scoping leads to wasted effort, missed deadlines, or over-committing your team. On the other hand, good scoping sets the foundation for execution, influence, and impact.</p>
<p>This blog post is my personal journal on learning to <strong>scope better</strong>. I plan to keep updating it with new experiences, reflections, and frameworks as I encounter different challenges.</p>
<h2 id="why-scoping-matters">Why Scoping Matters</h2>
<p>Scoping is more than estimating timelines. It’s about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing the right problems – Focus on work that delivers meaningful impact.</li>
<li>Defining clear boundaries – Avoid scope creep and ensure deliverables are realistic.</li>
<li>Aligning expectations – Make sure stakeholders, peers, and the team understand the “what” and “why.”</li>
<li>Maximizing leverage – Prioritize work that scales or unlocks further opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-approach-to-scoping">My Approach to Scoping</h2>
<p>I’ve found a few practical techniques that help me scope better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the problem, not the solution.
<ul>
<li>Ask: &ldquo;What’s the problem we are really trying to solve?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Break work into milestones.
<ul>
<li>Large projects can be intimidating; splitting them into digestible chunks helps estimate more accurately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Validate assumptions early.
<ul>
<li>Run experiments, talk to users, or gather data to avoid over-committing to uncertain work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a &ldquo;P0-P1-P2&rdquo; framework.
<ul>
<li>Clearly identify the highest priority work versus nice-to-have work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn from past projects.
<ul>
<li>Keep track of what was over- or under-scoped and adjust future estimates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-good-problems-to-solve">Finding Good Problems to Solve</h2>
<p>A critical part of scoping is <strong>finding good problems to tackle</strong>. Some ways I approach this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for problems with high leverage—fixes or features that benefit multiple teams or users.</li>
<li>Focus on repetitive pain points that slow down the org or team.</li>
<li>Seek ambiguous challenges where clarity and leadership can make a difference.</li>
<li>Align with org goals to ensure impact is recognized and resources are available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s iterative.
<ul>
<li>Scoping is rarely perfect the first time. Adjust as new information arrives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communication is key.
<ul>
<li>A well-scoped project is useless if the team and stakeholders don’t understand it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balance ambition and realism.
<ul>
<li>Stretch goals are fine, but over-promising hurts credibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>I will continue experimenting with different scoping strategies and documenting outcomes. Over time, I hope this post will become a living guide for myself and others on how to <strong>scope better</strong> as a tech lead.</p>
