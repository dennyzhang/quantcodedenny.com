* Work Challenges & Key Learnings                                  :noexport:
** Find the right problems
Challenges:
- Identifying impactful problems vs “noise.”
- Securing scope, alignment, and funding across stakeholders.

Learnings:
- Invest early in problem discovery and framing.
- Anchor decisions to business/infra impact to gain support.
** Driving Execution Across Teams
Challenges:

- Teams have different positions, priorities, and opinions.
- Alignment often requires negotiation and compromise.

Learnings:
- Clear communication and shared goals are essential.
- Build trust and credibility to influence without authority.
- Balance speed vs thoroughness based on context.
** Technical & System Complexity
Challenges:
- Dealing with infra-scale technical challenges (reliability, scalability, latency).
- Legacy issues (e.g., unreliable validation framework).

Learnings:
- Build guardrails and observability to make systems resilient.
- Incremental improvements often scale better than one-off fixes.
** Dependencies & Unreliable Components
Challenges:
- Cross-team and cross-system dependencies introduce fragility.
- Upstream changes or weak components can block progress.

Learnings:
- Invest in automated validation and monitoring to catch issues early.
- Design with failure scenarios in mind (graceful degradation, fallbacks).
** Delivering Impact Under Constraints
Challenge:
- Limited time, resources, and competing priorities make it impossible to build a “perfect” solution.

Learning:
- Define clear success criteria up front. Focus on what delivers the most impact, and avoid over-engineering.
** Evolving with Ambiguity
Challenges:
- Requirements and priorities shift frequently in Ads/Infra.
- Early-stage projects often lack clear ownership or metrics.

Learnings:
- Clarify success criteria early, but stay flexible as context evolves.
- Break down big ambiguous goals into smaller milestones to maintain momentum.

** People & Growth
Challenges:
- Scaling yourself beyond individual contribution.
- Onboarding and up-leveling new team members while delivering on projects.

Learnings:

Document and codify best practices (guardrails, playbooks, runbooks).

Mentoring and enabling others multiplies long-term impact.
