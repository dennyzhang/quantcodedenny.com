Working deeply in ML Infra (like Meta or Google) can make your skills feel too specialized. You solve critical problems — but the broader market may not see your full capability.
The key is to grow visibility and generalize impact organically, through habits you already do daily.
Understanding Interests vs. Positions
*TODO: Expand with real-life examples

Positions are what people say they want.
Interests are why they want it.
Asking &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions helps uncover underlying motivations.

Expanding the Pie: Creating Value

Brainstorm multiple solutions before negotiating.
Focus on solutions that cost you little but help the other party.
Example: If your team needs resources and leadership wants fast delivery, explore temporary staffing or automation.

Strategic Concessions

Trade things that are low cost for you but high value for them.
Always aim to ask for something in return.
Example: &ldquo;I can support your project if you help me with X later.&rdquo;

Framing Shared Wins

Explicitly show benefits for all parties.
Practice drafting talking points or emails that highlight mutual gains.
Example: &ldquo;This approach reduces errors for your team and meets our deadlines.&rdquo;

Practice in Low-Stakes Environments

Apply the principles to family decisions, small purchases, or team tasks.
Treat each negotiation as a mini-experiment.
Reflect: Did both sides feel good? Could more value have been created?

Post-Mortem and Continuous Improvement

Keep a Win-Win Journal: 1–2 entries per week.
Analyze:

Interests of both sides
Value created
Satisfaction of both parties
Lessons for next time



Tools and Frameworks

BATNA – Know your alternatives.
ZOPA – Identify the zone of possible agreement.
Principled Negotiation – Fisher &amp; Ury’s Getting to Yes framework.

TODO Future Improvements

Add real-life case studies.
Include examples from work and family scenarios.
Add diagrams showing negotiation flow.

Conclusion
Practicing win-win deals is a skill that compounds over time. By focusing on interests, creating value, and reflecting continuously, you can negotiate outcomes that strengthen relationships and achieve shared success.">
