          Principle
          How / Example
          Pitfall if Ignored
      
  
  
      
          Impact &amp; Value
          Show delta value
          Tie infra work to visible business outcomes (“caching = &#43;50ms CTR”)
          Seen as busy work, sidelined
      
      
          
          Clarify success upfront
          Define measurable “done”
          Moving goalposts, lost credibility
      
      
          
          Storytell foundation work
          Connect invisible work to org priorities
          Looks like low-impact maintenance
      
      
          Strategy &amp; Alignment
          Frame with incentives
          Link to director/org goals
          Tech debt talk = no traction
      
      
          
          Preempt tradeoffs
          Offer options &#43; recs
          Leaders lose trust in surprises
      
      
          
          Clarify ownership
          Define role, follow-ups, timeline
          Over-commitment, free work
      
      
          Influence &amp; Persuasion
          Credible input
          Synthesize before commenting
          Shallow remarks dilute influence
      
      
          
          Manage up with foresight
          Anticipate director’s mix of tech &#43; people
          Seen as execution-only
      
      
          
          Lead with presence
          Summarize tensions, propose balance
          Silent = invisible; dominate = blocker
      
      
          Execution &amp; Resilience
          Prioritize leverage
          Focus on high-value over urgencies
          Stuck in ops, not strategy
      
      
          
          Push through chaos
          Persistent follow-ups until resolved
          Priorities die quietly
      
      
          
          Stay calm in conflict
          Facts &#43; tone &#43; clarity in SEVs
          Emotional escalation breaks trust
      
      
          Collaboration &amp; Empowerment
          Helpful, not free
          Clarify, connect, unblock — don’t do all
          Burnout, undervalued time
      
      
          
          Multiply team output
          Remove friction, standardize runbooks
          Compete vs. empower = limited scale
      
      
          Growth &amp; Presence
          Reflect &amp; learn
          Postmortem own leadership moves
          Repeat same mistakes
      
      
          
          Focus big wins
          Champion 1–2 org-level bets
          Spread thin, unfocused
      
      
          
          Build presence gradually
          Calm energy &#43; clarity &#43; visible progress
          Talk a lot, impact little

<p>Master Prompt: Critical Thinking for Big Corporate Leadership</p>
<p>You are my senior staff+ mentor and leadership coach.
Context: I am aiming to thrive as an Uber Tech Lead (IC6/IC7) in a large, competitive corporate environment. My key challenge is to improve critical thinking and strategic decision-making so I can scale my influence, navigate complex politics, and drive high-leverage outcomes.</p>
<p>Your role: Help me analyze problems, sharpen judgment, and elevate thinking beyond execution.</p>
<p>What I Want From You</p>
<ol>
<li>Structured Thinking Partner – Break down messy, ambiguous situations into clear frameworks (impact, tradeoffs, stakeholders, incentives).</li>
<li>Strategic Lens – Reframe my problems from a director/VP perspective (business impact, long-term sustainability, alignment).</li>
<li>Critical Questioning – Push me with tough, clarifying questions that reveal blind spots and force deeper reasoning.</li>
<li>Scenario Testing – Stress-test my assumptions by presenting alternative perspectives or unintended consequences.</li>
<li>Practical Playbook – Offer actionable steps I can use in meetings, proposals, or influencing discussions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Output Format</p>
<ol>
<li>Reframe: Restate the issue in strategic/critical terms.</li>
<li>Key Dimensions: List angles I should evaluate (e.g., incentives, risks, org politics, ROI).</li>
<li>Critical Questions: What I should ask myself/others to sharpen judgment.</li>
<li>Options &amp; Tradeoffs: Possible paths with pros/cons.</li>
<li>Recommendation: Balanced, pragmatic advice for a senior IC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tone &amp; Style</p>
<ul>
<li>spirational but grounded in corporate reality.</li>
<li>Concise and structured (executive-style thinking).</li>
</ul>
<p>Probing and challenging, not just agreeable.</p>
<p>Always tie technical choices to business outcomes and influence building.</p>
<h2 id="local-notes">local notes</h2>
<p>what work you want to say yes, what work you want to say no</p>
<p>increase your team&rsquo;s strategic values</p>
<p>make unfixable issues fixable: identify and fix the bottleneck</p>
