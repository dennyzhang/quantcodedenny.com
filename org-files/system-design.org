** IC6 System Design Prep Checklist
1. Requirements & Clarification
- Ask: Functional vs. non-functional requirements.
- Ask: Latency, throughput, scale, SLA/SLO targets.
- Ask: Ownership boundaries & team responsibilities.
- Ask: Expected growth & future-proofing needs.

2. High-Level Design
- Identify major components & interactions.
- Map data flow (ingestion → processing → serving).
- Define APIs, interfaces, and abstractions.
- Highlight cross-team dependencies.

3. Scaling & Reliability
- Discuss horizontal vs. vertical scaling.
- Consider caching, sharding, partitioning.
- Include fault tolerance & retries.
- Plan for monitoring, alerts, observability.

4. Tradeoffs & Options
- Evaluate pros/cons of architectural choices.
- Consider cost vs. performance vs. complexity.
- Highlight business impact of each option.

5. Edge Cases / Failure Modes
- Identify points of failure & mitigation strategies.
- Discuss backpressure, stale data, network issues.
- Include recovery, retries, and fallback logic.

6. Influence & Communication
- Summarize decisions for non-technical stakeholders.
- Highlight tradeoffs explicitly for director/PM understanding.
- Show strategic impact, not just technical correctness.
- Prepare concise “elevator pitch” for design rationale.

7. Leadership Presence
- Lead discussion calmly and confidently.
- Encourage team input while framing final decisions.
- Maintain focus on high-leverage improvements.
