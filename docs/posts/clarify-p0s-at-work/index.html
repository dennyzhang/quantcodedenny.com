<h2 id="set-llm-context">Set LLM context</h2>
<p>I want to clarify what is truly important to me at work and identify my 3-year P0 priorities. Below is my current context.</p>
<p>Please help me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify <strong><strong>core work values</strong></strong> and any conflicts or trade-offs</li>
<li>Surface <strong><strong>blindspots or overlooked opportunities</strong></strong> in my current approach.</li>
<li>Suggest what could be my <strong><strong>3-year P0s</strong></strong> based on this context</li>
<li>Provide guidance on <strong><strong>filtering and prioritizing current workstreams</strong></strong> to align with these P0s.</li>
<li>Recommend <strong><strong>strategic milestones</strong></strong> or actions to maximize market value, ownership, and energy efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>Please make the output:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Structured and actionable</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong><strong>Compatible with Org-mode</strong></strong>, so I can copy it directly as a personal roadmap</li>
<li>Include examples of <strong><strong>practical steps, metrics, or checkpoints</strong></strong> for each milestone</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-content">My content</h2>
<p><strong><strong>Goals</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Work should have <strong><strong>market value</strong></strong> — skills and outcomes are recognized externally for future career mobility</li>
<li>Work should <strong><strong>minimize mental stress</strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>Superpowers</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Business Problem Focus</strong></strong>: Deliver measurable business wins rather than just technical solutions; able to quantify opportunity size and prioritize impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Cross-Team Execution</strong></strong>: Drive initiatives across multiple teams, aligning stakeholders to achieve shared goals efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>End-to-End Ownership</strong></strong>: Take full responsibility for projects from conception to delivery; trusted by cross-functional partners to execute reliably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Win-Win Partnership</strong></strong>: Build collaborative relationships; prioritize fairness and mutual benefit, avoiding one-sided wins at the expense of others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>Success stories</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Feature Deprecation &amp; Bad feature governance</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: Legacy and unused features caused inefficiencies and stale data risks.</li>
<li>Action: Built a <strong><strong>reliable feature usage lineage table</strong></strong>, automated cleanup, and implemented rapid mitigation plans.</li>
<li>Impact: Reduced stale features by X%, minimized downstream errors, and saved engineers’ time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Pipeline Push at Scale</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: Pushing streaming pipelines took up to 1 month and slowed model iteration.</li>
<li>Action: Optimized infrastructure and processes to enable <strong><strong>scalable, automated pipeline pushes</strong></strong>.</li>
<li>Impact: Reduced pipeline deployment time from 1 month → 1 week, accelerating feature iteration and business impact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>End-to-End Feature Infra Monitoring</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: Monitoring was fragmented across feature generation, serving, and model evaluation.</li>
<li>Action: Designed and implemented a <strong><strong>comprehensive monitoring framework</strong></strong> covering generating, serving, and model sides.</li>
<li>Impact: Enabled early detection of issues, reducing pipeline downtime and improving overall feature reliability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature Metadata Service</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: Lack of a single source of truth (SoT) for feature metadata made management and discovery difficult.</li>
<li>Action: Built a <strong><strong>centralized feature metadata service</strong></strong> covering both static and runtime metadata.</li>
<li>Impact: Enabled consistent feature management, improved discoverability, and reduced errors in feature usage across multiple ML teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>Key learnings</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Be more confident and assertive in requests</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Often acted as a supportive role with XFN teams, accepting the status quo when requests were deprioritized.</li>
<li>Example: Requested A team to validate outputs to reduce downstream issues, and asked B team to provide a library to check feature inclusion—both common, recurring needs.</li>
<li>Learning: I should confidently advocate for changes that enable teams to thrive, rather than silently accepting delays or partial solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Leverage leadership and existing structures</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Our team struggled multiple halves defining a team charter using a bottom-up strategy, which proved ineffective.</li>
<li>Insight: XFN teams already have dedicated roles (reliability for SEVs, efficiency for capacity, DevX for automation). Bottom-up attempts were redundant.</li>
<li>Learning: I should leverage leadership and existing structures early to avoid prolonged struggles and accelerate team effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Set bigger, strategic business goals</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Limited scope to immediate team bandwidth, focusing on incremental improvements.</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>HD feature cleanup: focused on small incremental changes rather than holistic cleanup.</li>
<li>Metadata service: implemented band-aid solutions instead of system simplification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning: I should aim for higher-leverage goals that drive strategic improvements rather than just immediate metrics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Spend more time generalizing problems and exchanging knowledge</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Often solved isolated problems without connecting patterns or sharing insights broadly.</li>
<li>Learning: I should step back to identify patterns across projects and actively exchange ideas with senior engineers outside the immediate area, enabling better solutions and knowledge transfer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Focus on high-impact technical challenges</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observation: Spent significant energy on team conflicts and headcount discussions, where I have less leverage as a tech lead.</li>
<li>Learning: I should focus on challenges where my <strong><strong>technical expertise</strong></strong> can make a real difference, and minimize time spent on organizational issues where my impact is limited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>My growth areas</strong></strong></p>
<h2 id="key-principles-to-navigate-corporates">Key principles to navigate corporates</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong><strong>Make Value Visible</strong></strong>: Only measurable wins are recognized; ensure your impact is quantified and communicated.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Align and Advocate</strong></strong>: Ownership and influence depend on stakeholder alignment and proactive advocacy.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Prioritize High-Leverage Work</strong></strong>: Focus on impactful initiatives over incremental or low-visibility tasks.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Leverage Structures, Don’t Reinvent</strong></strong>: Use existing roles, processes, and frameworks to accelerate results instead of building from scratch.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mitigation-organically-improve-market-value">Mitigation: Organically improve market value</h2>
<p>3 Pillars of Organic Market Value</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><strong>Skill Leverage</strong></strong>: Work on rare, transferable, high-impact skills.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Visible Impact</strong></strong>: Take ownership, quantify results, and share them internally.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Network &amp; Influence</strong></strong>: Extend your reputation through mentoring, cross-team work, and selective external visibility.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mitigation-lower-my-mental-stress-at-work">Mitigation: Lower My Mental Stress at Work</h2>
<p><strong><strong>Two Directions</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Systemic Strategies (Change the way you work)
<ul>
<li>Modify workflow, environment, or collaboration patterns to reduce stress triggers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal Strategies (Manage your mind &amp; energy)
<ul>
<li>Strengthen mental and physical resilience to handle unavoidable stress effectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>Guiding Principles</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Focus on What Matters (Systemic)</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize high-leverage work that aligns with goals and measurable impact.</li>
<li>Limit low-value tasks; delegate or say no where possible.</li>
<li>Daily Check: Identify 1–3 MITs (Most Important Tasks) each week/day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect Your Time &amp; Energy (Systemic + Personal)</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule deep-work blocks and micro-breaks; batch similar tasks.</li>
<li>Set boundaries with collaborators and deadlines to reduce last-minute pressure.</li>
<li>Daily Check: Reserve uninterrupted focus time and buffer slots for unexpected requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make Work Predictable (Systemic)</p>
<ul>
<li>Document responsibilities, deadlines, and assumptions to reduce surprises.</li>
<li>Confirm expectations with stakeholders; plan for sudden changes.</li>
<li>Daily Check: Review blockers and clarify ambiguous tasks at the start of the day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recharge Your Mind &amp; Body (Personal)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep, hydrate, eat well, and exercise to maintain baseline energy.</li>
<li>Use mental resets: short walks, breathing exercises, or journaling.</li>
<li>Reflect on wins and challenges to improve awareness and emotional regulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
