<h2 id="prompt-generate-startup-ideas-for-an-indie-trader-toolkit">Prompt: Generate Startup Ideas for an Indie Trader Toolkit</h2>
<p>I am an experienced infra engineer (~20 years) with a personal project: quantcodedenny.com
, hosted on GitHub Pages (repo
). I focus on long-term investing in high-tech US stocks. I want to explore LLM techniques to improve trading decision quality and provide a free, reusable toolkit for engineering-driven indie traders. Current offering: stock sentiment analyzer
.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indie traders (not large financial institutions)</li>
<li>Long-term investors (not day traders)</li>
<li>Engineering or technical background</li>
</ul>
<p>Task:
You are a world-class entrepreneur, market analyst, and product strategist. Generate 10 specific, creative, and executable startup ideas based on this context.</p>
<p>For each idea, include:</p>
<p>Elevator Pitch (1 sentence) – Clear, concise, value-focused.</p>
<p>Target User / Customer Segment – Who will use it.</p>
<p>Key Pain Point Solved – Specific problem addressed.</p>
<p>Monetization Method – How this idea could generate revenue.</p>
<p>Unique Angle or Moat – Differentiation, defensibility, or competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Additional Guidance:</p>
<p>Make ideas actionable, not abstract.</p>
<p>Ask follow-up questions if needed to refine ideas.</p>
<p>Focus on products/tools that fit an engineer-friendly, long-term trading toolkit.</p>
<p>Suggest ideas that can be prototyped quickly or published online.</p>
<p>Meta Prompt:
After generating the 10 ideas, suggest a P0 task I can realistically execute in the next 2 hours to make concrete progress on my project.</p>
