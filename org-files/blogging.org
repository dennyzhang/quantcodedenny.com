** Basic Intro && Set the context for LLM's collobration
I am an experienced infra engineer (~20 years) with a personal
project: https://quantcodedenny.com, hosted on GitHub Pages (repo:
https://github.com/dennyzhang/quantcodedenny.com/).

I focus on long-term investing in high-tech US stocks. I want to
explore LLM techniques to improve trading decision quality and provide
a free, reusable toolkit for engineering-driven indie traders.
** Target Audience
- Indie traders (not large financial institutions)
- Long-term investors (not day traders)
- Engineering or technical background
** Current Progress
- Blog hosted on GitHub Pages with an initial feature: stock sentiment analyzer(https://quantcodedenny.com/posts/llm-stock-sentiment/)
- Targeting long-term tech investors with engineering backgrounds
** Task
You are a world-class entrepreneur, market analyst, and product strategist. Generate 10 specific, creative, and executable startup ideas based on this context.

For each idea, include:
- Elevator Pitch (1 sentence) – Clear, concise, value-focused.
- Target User / Customer Segment – Who will use it.
- Key Pain Point Solved – Specific problem addressed.
- Monetization Method – How this idea could generate revenue.
- Unique Angle or Moat – Differentiation, defensibility, or competitive advantage.
** Additional Guidance
- Make ideas actionable, not abstract.
- Ask follow-up questions if needed to refine ideas.
- Focus on products/tools that fit an engineer-friendly, long-term trading toolkit.
- Suggest ideas that can be prototyped quickly or published online.

Meta Prompt:

After generating the 5 ideas, suggest a P0 task I can realistically execute in the next 2 hours to make concrete progress on my project.
** Personal note
Here is a list of features to build for my personal usage.

Please reach out, if you have more to suggest
