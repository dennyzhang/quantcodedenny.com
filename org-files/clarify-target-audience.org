I want to help indie engineers and long-term traders unlock the power of LLMs
for quantitative investing. My focus is on building practical
tools—like reusable prompt packs, signal extractors, and AI-assisted
research workflows—that simplify market analysis and
decision-making. Instead of overwhelming dashboards, I provide
lightweight, engineer-friendly solutions that save time, reduce noise,
and surface the insights that really matter. Over time, this evolves
into a library of reusable AI frameworks for trading—blending deep
technical rigor with the accessibility needed by individual investors.
