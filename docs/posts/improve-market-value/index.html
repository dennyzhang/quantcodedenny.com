Working deeply in a specialized area like Meta or Google ML infra can easily make your expertise feel too narrow — you solve critical problems, but your broader market value may not fully reflect your capabilities. This post is a living document to help tech leads organically increase market value, stay visible, and continuously improve.
1. Guiding Principles

Think End-to-End

Always maintain a mental map of the full system — data flows, dependencies, upstream/downstream impacts, and business objectives.
Avoid getting trapped in local optimization that doesn’t move the business needle.


Translate Impact into Language the Market Understands

Frame accomplishments in terms of revenue, cost savings, reliability, or scale.
Example: &ldquo;Reduced ad delivery latency by 15%&rdquo; → &ldquo;Improved ad revenue predictability by X%&rdquo;.


Balance Depth with Breadth

Deep technical mastery is necessary, but marketable leaders understand context and patterns beyond their domain.
Learn industry-standard practices in system design, reliability, and observability — even if you don’t apply them directly every day.


Document and Share Your Thinking

Writing blog posts, notes, or internal wikis shows both clarity of thought and knowledge-sharing ability.
Enables future opportunities to easily identify your impact.


Leverage Cross-Team Learning

Seek input from other teams to understand tradeoffs, common pitfalls, and best practices.
Increases visibility and broadens your domain expertise.



2. Good Practices

  
      
          Practice
          Why it Works
          Example
      
  
  
      
          Framing a P0 incident with root cause &amp; business impact
          Shows problem-solving and business acumen
          &ldquo;Ad infra SEV reduced ads served by 10%; we implemented a cache strategy that restored 100% within 3 hours.&rdquo;
      
      
          Designing scalable systems with foresight
          Highlights technical leadership
          Using sharded pipelines anticipating 10x growth in queries.
      
      
          Sharing reusable learnings
          Demonstrates influence
          Internal blog posts or shared runbooks that prevent repeated mistakes across teams.
      
      
          Asking strategic questions before designing
          Shows judgment beyond execution
          &ldquo;If we scale 5x, how will this design handle eventual consistency and data staleness?&rdquo;
      
  

3. Bad Practices

  
      
          Practice
          Why it Hurts
          Example
      
  
  
      
          Focusing only on local optimization
          Can obscure marketable impact
          Fixing a single API latency without quantifying broader effect.
      
      
          Not documenting decisions
          Reduces visibility &amp; credibility
          Team forgets key design choices; knowledge is siloed.
      
      
          Avoiding ambiguous problems
          Signals lack of leadership
          Ignoring a system-level problem because &ldquo;it’s not my area.&rdquo;
      
      
          Over-reliance on specific tech
          Limits future mobility
          Mastering internal infra tools without understanding underlying principles.
      
  

4. Daily Runbook Approach

Daily Reflection: Capture what you learned, decisions made, and tradeoffs considered.
Weekly Market Mapping: Identify external relevance — could your work be applied elsewhere? How would you explain it in industry terms?
Monthly Patterns Review: Aggregate recurring issues, solutions, and lessons learned.
Quarterly LLM Update: Use an LLM to summarize, reframe, and extract marketable insights.

5. LLM Prompt Template for Continuous Improvement
Context:
I am a tech lead working in Meta Ads Infra.
I am maintaining a runbook of learnings, decisions, and tradeoffs.

Task:
1. Summarize the key patterns and decisions from the following notes.
2. Highlight marketable achievements in a way understandable outside my company.
3. Identify gaps in breadth or end-to-end thinking that could increase my market value.
4. Suggest improvements or principles I should focus on next.
