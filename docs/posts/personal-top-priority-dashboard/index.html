🌟 Vision
Live a healthy, confident, and wealthy life — balanced across family, personal growth, and financial freedom.
Focus on high-leverage actions and eliminate noise.
🎯 Key Objectives (FCM)
1. Family — Build a Healthy and Happy Family

Stay emotionally connected with kids and spouse
Maintain routines for health and stress management

Daily / Weekly Goals

 15–30 min 1:1 focused play with son (3x/week)
 Evening family meal without devices (2x/week)
 Weekly 30-min sync with spouse to review week and connect
 Exercise 2–3x per week, sleep 7h/night
 Plan 1 weekend activity per month with family
Avoid overthinking or struggling too long in dead ends

2. Confidence — Strengthen Personal and Professional Growth

Increase professional market value
Improve appearance and communication skills
Build meaningful, positive connections

Daily / Weekly Goals

 Attend design reviews weekly
 Work on high-impact project tasks daily
 Connect with 1 mentor/peer weekly
 Update wardrobe/grooming monthly — helps improve confidence, first impressions, and self-perception
 Publish or present 1 idea per quarter
Avoid overthinking or setting too many small, fragmented goals

3. Money — Grow Wealth with Leverage

Earn through smart, sustainable investing
Focus energy on high-return opportunities

Daily / Weekly Goals

 Review investment decisions weekly and track lessons learned
 Track key financial metrics daily/weekly
 Automate savings/investments
 Delegate or outsource low-value tasks
Avoid over-optimizing trivial details

⚙️ Guiding Principles
1. Prioritize What Truly Matters

Focus on high-impact tasks
Say no to low-value work or non-essential goals

2. Evolve Mindset Continuously  (E6 → E7 Upgrade)

Think in systems and first principles — solve root causes, not symptoms
Apply growth mindset — treat mistakes as learning opportunities and embrace ambiguity
Create leverage — empower others, clarify processes, and automate repeat work
Lead through influence — align people and decisions without authority
Default to reflection &gt; reaction

3. Spend Smartly to Earn More

Buy time and energy via good services

4. Build systems and habits that compound over years, not weeks
🔍 Daily / Weekly Reflection

Check off goals in each section to track progress
Reflect on energy usage and focus areas rather than a separate checklist
Keep routines simple and repeatable
Build compounding systems over time
